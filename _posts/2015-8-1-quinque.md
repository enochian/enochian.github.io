Following are notes on the "Five Books of Mystery" (Sloane 3188), covering December 22, 1581 to May 23, 1583. These *libers* begin with an abortive attempt at scrying using Barnabas Saul and proceed immediately into the successes attained as Edward Kelley (originally referred to as Edward Talbot) arrives at Mortlake. They detail the reception of the Enochian temple furniture, and precede the records reproduced in *A True and Faithful Relation*.
