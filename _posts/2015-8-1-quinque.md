Following are notes on the "Five Books of Mystery" (Sloane 3188), covering December 22, 1581 to May 23, 1583. These *libers* begin with an abortive attempt at scrying using Barnabas Saul and proceed immediately into the successes attained as Edward Kelley (originally referred to as Edward Talbot) arrives at Mortlake. They detail the reception of the Enochian temple furniture, and precede the records reproduced in *A True and Faithful Relation*.

There is a spirit, named Lundrumguffa using you who seketh your destruction, in the hatred of
men, in the hurt of thy goods. Discharge him to morrow with Brymstone.187 He haunteth thy howse,
and seketh the destruction of thy dowghter. His pretence was to haue maymed thee in thy Sholder the

# Secundus

**LIber Secundus** pertains completely to the reception of the Sigillum Dei {110} Aemaeth {49!} = {159 - is there a way to spell so it = 156? Or is 9 simply the inversion of 6?}, the seven-fold seal that forms the basis of the Enochian furniture.

An earlier version of the Sigillum Dei appears in **Liber iuratus**, a 13th or 14th century grimoire colloquially referred to as the "Sworn Booke," spuriously attributed to Honorious, the son of Euclid. As Euclid died three centuries before the birth of Christ, such an authorial attribution boggles the mind until we remember that Medieval writers often attributed their works to historical personages as a way not only to associate their works with a known stream of thought, and claim prestige thereby, but also as a way of preserving anonymity in a hostile religious climate. The vast number of Hermetic works attributed to "Hermes Trismegistus" are a perfect example of this authorial tradition. A more recent example would be the collective use of the name ["Luther Blissett"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Blissett_(nom_de_plume)) by European leftist activists in the 1990s.

The **Liber iuratus** version of the seal is made by constructing "first a circle whose diameter is three fingers, because of the three cross-nails of the Lord, or five fingers because of the five wounds of Christ, or seven for the seven sacraments, or nine for the nine orders of angels, but usually five fingers will suffice. Then make a second within this circle, let it be a distance from the first two grains because of the two Tablets of the Law of Moses, or three grains because of the persons of the Trinity" ([here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigillum_Dei)). [Note that this version also centers on the word EL - Al - Liber Al.]

[(PDF of Sworn Book here)](http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/grimoire/grimoireofhonorius.pdf)

<center><img src="http://www.esotericarchives.com/juratus/aemeth3.jpg"></center>

One of the oldest European grimoires, the Sworn Book is allegedly the condensation of knowledge produced at a conference of operative magicians, and contains 93 chapters—93 being a number of immense importance to Aleister Crowley's Thelema as enumerating to both "Thelema" (will) and "Agape" (love) in Greek gematria, and therefore forming a mathematical signature of his formula of "Love under Will." Present-day Thelemites greet each other with the salutation "93" and speak of the socio-magical milieu surrounding Crowley's system as the "93 Current." The chapters cover the range of classical magical techniques, from finding treasure to conjuring demons. Like many medieval grimoires (which it perhaps formed the key influence for), the Sworn Book purports to be a manual of summoning "perverse Spirits of Darkness," and therefore demands ritual purity and Christian piety as prerequisites for use. This method of operation—long theurgic preparation before goetic conjuration—forms the basic magic theory of medieval European magic. Though Dee and Kelley [c/a] did not attempt goetic conjuration during their sessions, they followed the same protocol; copies of Dee's pre-session prayers to Jesus—his "Fundamental Obeisance" and others—remain extant. The approach remains consistent even into the 20th century, albeit in the more modern form of Crowley's insistence on attaining to the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (the theurgic Magnum Opus par excellance) before attempting other works of magic. The approach breaks down only with the chaos magick insistence on the non-reality of gods and spirits as anything other than constructions of human belief; outside of this postmodern approach, there is little shift in magical procedures throughout the second Millennium.

Like the Dee manuscripts, the Sworn Book was part of the initial Sloane materials that formed the basis of the British Library. One version thereof—Sloane MS 313—is directly from the library of John Dee, and contains notes in his handwriting ([here](http://www.esotericarchives.com/juratus/juratus.htm)). 

(Peterson: "John Dee, in his Mystical Experiments, was originally told to use a version found in one of his books. Dee consulted several sources, and consulted the angels to resolve the discrepancies. This prompted them to detail an almost totally new version of the Sigillum Dei. One of Dee's sources was apparently Sl.313. Roberts and Watson, in their 1990 John Dee's Library Catalogue, pg. 168, identify Sloane 313 as being one of Dee's manuscripts. They give it catalog number DM70, and note, "On fol.9 (originally the first leaf, fol.1-8 having been misbound) is [Dee's ladder symbol] and, very faint, 'Fragmentum Magicum', which may be in Dee's hand. At the foot is 'Sum Ben: Jonsonij liber'."")

[This begs more research - I believe it is mentioned later by the spirits.]

The seal would re-appear in the 20th century as the seal of Aleister Crowley's A.'.A.'., where it is explicitly connected with the goddess BABALON, who appears at the very end of the Spirit Diaries. Both BABALON and the Seal make repeated appearances in *The Vision and the Voice*.

### On Astrology

James A. Eshelman's use of astrology to refine the analysis of Enochian visions, as shown in *Visions & Voices*, is immensely useful in winnowing out "ambient" astral information from the content of the visions themselves. While we have imprecise times and dates for the workings, we may be able to reconstruct some of this approach to Dee and Kelley's sessions.

As far as dates: Elias Ashmole on dates of “2nd Book” (is this Secundus or a section of Secundus)? states: Between March 21 - April 28 1582, records are wanting. Michael angry Dee has been slack on the 28th. Ashmole suggests that actions were on March 21 and April 28, and between them not much happened—some kind of falling out between Dee and Kelley which was reconciled.  

Location: Mortlake is located at 51n28, 0w16

Charts with approximated times will be included with each action. These are imprecise as we don't have the right time ranges. Where available, times will be guessed from the records (i.e. in Action Six, the Dee and Kelley ask the angels if they can leave for dinner at a certain point).

Charts will be drawn using Sidereal astrology (Fagan/Bradley calculation), for the simple reason that Tropical is not accurate.

### On Angelic Cryptography

The forty characters are obviously cryptography. The question is: What's the code? Each white creature gives some variation on a letter/number combination—Roman letters, although Dee later annotated *Secundus* to suggest that these letters be changed to Enochian characters. The following codes *may* be successfully applied (if we work backwards from *The Vision and the Voice*):

- Transliterations of Latin words into English words into Enochian words (using Laycock) and adding Hebrew Qabalistic analysis. 

[For instance: An angel in Action Six states "Regnabit Iniquitas pro tempore." = "Wickedness will rule for a time." In Enochian, wickedness = BABALON. Time = CAPIMAO; Rule = BOGPA, SONF. Babalon bogpa capimao. (Or thereabouts.) The key, however, is that in Qabalah, Time = Saturn, and Saturn = Binah, the sphere of Babalon, who is the Queen of the City of the Pyramids (Binah). So literally "Regnabit Iniquitas pro tempore" = "Wickedness will rule for a time" may = "Babalon reigns in the City of Pyramids."]
 
- Associations of the colors, functions and actions of the angels to Qabalah
- Hebrew Qabalah and Gematria, in comparison with:
- Enochian Gematria
- Latin Qabalah Simplex
- Astrological data.
- Comparison with the rest of the Dee material.
- Comparison with Elizabethan cryptography techniques in general. (Walsingham.)

## Sixth Action (March 1582)—"40 White Creatures of Sigillum Dei"

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9LB2u4D.gif"></center>

*Dramatis Personae.* Dee, Kelley, Michael, Uriel, Semiel, and the 40 White Creatures.

(Titles in quotes are mine.) This action contains missing pages. 

Michael (Fortitudio Dei) appears, along with Uriel (who is clearly subservient to Michael in their social interactions); he later calls Semeliel (Dee note—"this etymology as though he were the secretary for the Name of God") as a subservient angel. He tells the two that nothing is cut from the Church of God, and that the two are blessed among the Saints. But that Kelley will be separated from temptation.

Angels will separate Dee & Kelley from the impure. Kelley has committed idolatry, but they will right him. 

The seal is now revealed—the "true Circle of his eternity comprehending all virtue."

The forty white creatures appeared one by one, announcing the characters around the Sigillum Dei Aemeth. They all appeared as children, in long, white silk robes.

Michael appeared over all of them, became giant with two legs like pillars of brass, and drew a sword of fire over all 40 of their heads. This caused an earthquake, and they all fell to their knees; Michael now called the angel Semiael to explain the Great Seal. Uriel also fell to his knees before the might of Michael's sword; as Michael swung his flaming sword, flaming fire like lightning also flashed "with all" of the forty white creatures. 

Each of the forty White Creatures steps forward in turn, kneeling and unveiling a number/letter combination on their breast.

Latin Qabalah Simplex values of phrases are listed in {} brackets after Latin phrases. LQS is, I believe, a creation of James A. Eshelman and is simply a matter of assigning numerical values in sequence to the Roman alphabet (i.e. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on to end of sequence). Values ere here calculated using [Gerard del Campo's gematria program.](http://test.thelemistas.org/en/Tools/gematria?system=LatinSimplex) I believe there is a Latin Qabalah Simplex basic Sepher 500 published in *Black Pearl* but we so far have not tabulated these values to any other phrases, this remains for future work.

**Note:** In most depictions of Dee's Sigillum, the letters are listed in English. In the footnotes of Liber Secundus Dee stipulates that some of these letters are in Enochian. However it is not clear if all of these letters were given in Enochian, as some (see 4/T) have specific designs that are neither English or Enochian, and yet others are given in "Roman" letters. It seems that here a purist Enochian magician would do well to re-construct the Sigillum from each entry in *Liber Secundus*. 

Translations to 18/o are from Google Translate; past that are Joseph Peterson's. 

**4/T [Gisg].** Gold character in silk-covered breast. (The T is a specific design, see th book.) 40: "It liveth and multiplieth forever: Blessed be his name." Michael: "Place that in first place. It is the name of the Lord." Vanishes in fire.

It seems Dee later went back after the reception of the Enochian language and may have noted that these letters could be changed to Enochian.] Clap of thunder appearance. "Praise God, for his name is reverent." Michael: "Deus Deus Deus noster, benedictus es nunc et semper: Amen." {498} (May God, our God, and blessed art thou, now and forever, Amen.)

**22/o [Med].** Round tablet in forehead. M: Et non est finis in illo. {216} (And there is no end in him.) Benedictus es tu Deus. {198} (Blessed art Thou, O God.) He flies away like round rainbow knit together at ends. (Samekh? Chokmah?) [Repeated round symbolism.]

Tu es primus O Halleluyah. {556} Angels, one at thy name they shall fall down, O Lord. You are the first O Halleluyah. One angel left standing while all others fall: Sword comes from mouth, point is triangle, in midst is small a (a in triangle), "Et Numerus tuus viuit in caeteris" {364}(And the number of the rest of your lives). Goes away with great lightning covering rest of the world. M: "Nomen illius est nobiscum." {253} (His name is with us)

**14/n [Drux].** One n on breast (14). On back very many n's. M: Creasti tu domine Angelos tuos ad Gloriam tuam. {413} (To the glory of the Angels, didst thou, my lord your crease.). Et te primus Creauit Deus. {248} (And you first , God created). Flies up like star.

Falls down in dust unto the earth, white garment flies up like white smoke, white thing flies out his body. "Surgit Innocentia ad faciem Dei." {238} (Rises innocence to the face of God)

Michael over them with sword again, which lightens. Speaks, stops, fire flies from mouth. "Innocentium Nomina, et sanguinem vidisti Domine a Terra, et Iustus es in operibus tuis." {816} (The names of Innocent , and the blood by the earth as seen, O Lord , and Thou art just, in thy works.)

M: "Non est illi numerus. Omnia pereunt a facie Dei, et a facie Terrae." {501} (There is no number. All will perish from the face of God, and from the face of the earth.)

**18/o [Med].** Steps forth like water running round about him: "O benedictum Nomen tuum Domine. Numerus perijt cum illis." {533} (Oh, blessed be the name of thy Lord . The number perished with them.) Vanishes, great water remains overall. M: "Lux manet in tenebris. Gloriosum est Nomen tuum." {476} (The light remains in the dark. Glorious is Thy name.)

**l [Ur]/8.** All: Benedictus est qui sic et sic est {298}. (Blessed is he who is so and so), throwing into air three cornered cutting boards (for food) in gold. On one side of each is marked a isosceles triangle with cross in it and four dots in inner corners (see book). One comes out, with transparent body, L in eyes, 8 on forehead. All: Et es verus in operibus tuis {300}. (And you are true in your works.) Vanishes in flame.

**a/8 [Un].** Target and little 8/a on it. Went away. (Originally 8/a but corrected by Uriel—note, this is *wrong* in the printed versions of the Sigillum I've found.) Regnabit Iniquitas pro tempore. {304} (Wickedness will rule for a time.) [JL: "Wicked" = BABALON in Enochian. Time = Saturn. Binah.]

**16/r [Don].** Golden crown [Tiphareth? Kether?], great arming sword. Clothing of gold, 16/r on sword. Went away. M: Nulla regnat virtus super terram. {347} (No power rules upon the earth)

[Chesed?] Burnt into forehead; n. M: Non est numerus illius in Caelis. {316} Went away. M: Antiquus serpens extulit capit suum deuorans Innocentes. Halleluyah. (692, or 599 w/o Halleluyah.) (The ancient serpent has raised up his head, devouring the innocent.) [**DING DING DING DING**]

[Note and compare repetitions of "n" alone]

*6/a [Un].* Puts off white habit, takes sword, smites up into air, thundered, and he had a seal suddenly there od gorgeous gold and precious stones. Regnum meum. Quis Contradicet? {278} (My Kingdom. Who resists it?) [Malkuth] Out of his mouth, many little n's, A on forehead. M: Non quod est A, sed quod contradicit A. {313} Nec protio, nec numerus euus invenitur in caelo. {454} Habet autem Numerum terrestrem. {308} Mysterium. {127} "It is not because he is A, but because he resists A. Neither his portion nor his number are discovered in heaven. Therefore he has the number of the earth, which is a mystery." (Malkuth/Mystery Babylon?) He shows three figures of 6: 6 <sup>6</sup> 6, set in triangle. Vobis est Mysterium hoc, posterius reuelandum. {481} ("A mystery to be revealed to us.")(Peterson: "A mystery is to be revealed to you afterward." Does this mean the coming of the Aeon of Horus, Vision/Voice sessions and the coming of the Beast Therion?) Fire consumes him and his chair away suddenly. 

[Where do Michael's interstitial announcements go? Attributions not clear if pertaining to White Creature exiting or incoming.] M: Perturbatur terra iniquitate sua. {352} (The earth is thrown into confusion by his/her wickedness.) (Malkuth -> Coronzom -> Babalon?)

perturbō ‎(present infinitive perturbāre, perfect active perturbāvī, supine perturbātum); first conjugation

I confuse
I disturb or perturb
I trouble or alarm {JL: "Frater Perturbo" funny joke}

*O [Med]/10.* Spirit's garments are white under, face brass, he is a leper. O/10 on breast. Departs. (Uriel: "The first letter of Perturbatur, doth not make shew, of the letter following as other before did. {?}) M: Surgite O Ministri Dei: Surgite (inquam) Pugnate: Nomen Dei est aeternum. {432} (Arise, O servants of God. Arise (I say) and fight. The Name of God is eternal.)

All leave. Michael returns with two, and says "Hij duo Caelati sunt adhuc" {210—NOX}. (These two were still hidden = 2 to 0?) They go away.

M: Vale. Natura habet terminum suum. {303} (Farewell. Nature has its own limit.) 

He blesses with sword, Uriel follows him (Uriel has not appeared during these visions).

After dinner Kelley retires to prayer. Uriel appears and says something's off in the seal.
Some dodginess w Kelley.
M: Veritas est sola in DEO. Et haec omnia vera sunt. {402} Michael says Dee ommitted nothing, but Kelley forgot to tell you some stuff.

Shewer, white man, plucks out trumpet. He again does not blow. At end of trumpet appears a lower-case omega (i.e., one of—the last?—trumpets of Apocalypse?) [Greek Qabalah value: 800]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_trumpets

"In Christian Eschatology, the first six trumpets are used to serve as a wake up call to the sinners on Earth and a call to repentance. Each trumpet blast brings with it a plague of a more disastrous nature than the one before it. The trumpet is used to build anticipation and tells the reader that an alert, announcement, or warning is about to take place. The seventh trumpet does not bring a plague with it. Rather, it is sounded so that glory is given to God and His kingdom is announced."

Christians who follow the Posttribulation rapture doctrine, argue that the seventh trumpet is the last trumpet mentioned in I Corinthians 15:52,[21] and that there is a strong correlation between the events mentioned in Isaiah 27:13,[22] Matthew 24:29-31,[23] and I Thessalonians 4:16.[24] These parallels are used to support the doctrine of the rapture occurring after the tribulation. Therefore, Posttribulationists see the rapture happening during the seventh trumpet. The nature of the 7th trumpet shows that "time is no more, and that the mystery of God is finished, Rev. 10:6,7. At the 7th trumpet, Jesus rules and reigns forevermore,[25] He has taken His great power and reigned,[26] and He rewards the righteous, and judges the wicked.[27] Both Jesus and Paul declare that when Jesus comes, His reward is with Him, and He rewards everyone according to their works, Rev. 22:12,2 Tim 4:1.

Of the three 6 <sup>6</sup> 6 noted, he puts out two lowermost w finer, says: Iste est numerus suus. {260} {This is his number}  

Mist and horrible thunder arise. M puts his finger into trumpet and pulls out a gold plate with a round plate of gold in it, whereon is the figure "i" [but not Gon? drawn as Roman i] with many circles about. He says: Omnia unum es {129} Everything is one. Semeliel vanishes. 

Michael sits in chair, legs gone. 

Laudate Dominium in Sanctus eius {304} Praise the lord in his sanctuary


Circumference, which is done, has 7 names. 7 names contain 7 angels. Every letter contain 7 angels. The numbers are applied to the letters. When you know the 7 names, you will understand the 7 angels. 

Michael on decrypting the circumference: Start with 4 (over T) and read to the right—taking number for the next slot with letter to be read etc...

[Duquette: Count clockwise when the number in the cell is positioned above the letter; count counterclockwise when the letter is positioned above the number.

<center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/KiiKv0v.png></center>


You read until you hit a letter block with no number. So the first one would be:

thAaoth

[Note: Aa seems to suggest Hebrew. Heb. would be:

ThA'aoTh - Tau Ayin Vau Tau - Earth Capricorn Taurus Earth - all Earth signs. Heb: 876. (Nothing by Lib 500)

It also, of course, seems to be the name Thoth.

Dee does this. However, Michael says: Nope, wrong. You'll understand in the next call. 

## Action Eight (Later, same day)—More instruction, promise of *Soyga*

M: Double letters are double numbers, being the Name of God. (Specifically Aa: So Heb was perhaps wrong.) So when you double letters up, combine. ThAOTh

Dee mentions the 42-letter name of God:

<center><img src=http://cdn1.kabbalah.com/wisdom/AnabKoach.png></center>

Dee explains this as Latin: Pater Deus, Filius Deus, spiritus sanctus Deus: Tres in uno, et unus in tribus. Vel Trinitas in unitate et unitas in Trinitate. {1241} (Trinitarian Creed etc.)

Pater Deus, Filius Deus, et Spiritus Sanctus, Deus, attamen non tres Dij sed unus Deus. {807}

Sicut anima rationalis, et caro, homo unus, ita Deus et homo Messias unus. {659} (As the rational mind and flesh of a person are one, so too are God and man one messiah.) [Ruach + Nephesch = 1 [Serpent?]; Deus + Homo = Messiah (357)]

(Some calculations relating the 40 numbers outwith with the 42 letter name of God, which is there in potential but not actuality...?)

42-letter name is Ana B'Koach—7 names of 6 letters each, for 7 planets/days of the week.

"Satan" in QBLH being the force of division - dividing things.

Out of this circle no creature shall pass, that entereth, if he be made upon the Earth.
This circle created all beasts etc of Earth, as will be revealed in Adam's Treatise From Paradise (Liber Soyga).
Alpha and Omega:
Primus et Nouissimus; unus solus Deus viuit nunc et semper: Hic est, et hic erit: Et hic, sunt Nomina sua Diuina. {1060} (First and newest, one alone God lives now and ever: He is and he will be, and here are his Divine Names. I have spoken."

Benedicamus Dominum. {167} (Let us bless the Lord)

Blessed are those whose portion is not with the wicked.
Wicked = BABALON.
portion not with wicked = who have given all, not just a portion (speck of dust) to Babalon?

## Action Nine—March 20, 1582, 10:00:00

<center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TH1Ge6b.gif></center>

Dee makes, corrects and uses new prayers. Uriel appears with thanks and says they can't appear now, but will come at noon. [Note: Gemini is ascendant, perhaps suggesting that communication will be unclear?]

Dee: Fiat voluntas Dei. {161}

## Skipped Action—March 20, 1582, 12:00:00

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eih7mo5.gif"></center>

This is the time Uriel requested Dee and Kelley to call him at—Kelley drops the ball and they don't get it together until 2 PM. Of course, the only sign that has changed is the Ascendant—the horizon line—from Gemini to Cancer. Note that the ascendant changes every two hours—specifically suggesting that Uriel was waiting out Gemini, as he tells Dee to try again in two hours. Gemini tends to have an association with duplicitous or two-faced communication, perhaps suggesting Uriel either wanted clear lines or wanted to make sure *Dee and Kelley* were communicating properly, or even that the magic-as-communication itself worked properly. Interesting stuff.

## Action Ten—March 20, 1582, 14:00:00

<center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MdtuQFg.gif></center>

[Ascendant still in Cancer, but about to click over into Leo]

Michael and Uriel appear immediately in stone (as if waiting?) M goes and returns with another angel on his right shoulder, carrying 7 little white baskets of gold. M wants the doors shut. 7 baskets hung round canopy of beaten gold. 

Ecce, Mysterium est. Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel. {465} (Behold, it is a mystery. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel. Psalm 7:18)

Canopy stretched to cover all the world (world, heaven, earth in stone) so heaven can be seen. Baskets hang in border of horizon [Note the Ascendant, horizon calculations; also Horus as lord of Horizon?]

Dee asks for Sapientiam {97}, Wisdom (Chokmah).

Dee gives the 7 names he has generated, and Michael corrects the spellings and orders, giving:

Galas
Gethog
Thaoth
Hor[omega]n = Horon
Innon
Aaoth
Galethog

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Galas</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Gethog</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Thaoth</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Horon</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Innon</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Aaoth</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Galethog</p></center>



Michael now adds the figures in the "almond slice" shaped figures above each of the seven heptagonal sides, followed by a cross over circle with joined "OG" inside it. After each letter shows he puts it in his bosom. Each circle segment is pure gold. 

M: Omnia unum est. {147} (All is one)

M pulls all 7 plates from bosom, Uriel kneels down.

Basket of east is opened. M: Divide the 7 parts of circle next unto that which thou hast done, every one, into 7. Dee: Seven, rest in 7: and the 7, live by 7: The 7, govern the 7: And by 7, all Government is. Blessed be he, yea blessed be the Lord: praised be our god. His Name be magnified. All honor and Glory be unto him now and for ever. Amen.

Michael pulls seven birds out of baskets, each with letters in its feathers.

[These form the names of the seven sides of the heptagon inside the outer rung.]

[Note: [Language of the Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds)]

[These may be Qabalistic code; they seem more suggestive of alchemical emblems, however.]

**1. ZllRHia** White pigeon. Z on 1st 7 feathers of breast, first feather on left side. M: Mystery in 7, which are the 7 governing the 7 which govern the earth.

**2. aZCaacb** White swan. M: Dixit et factum est. {181} (He spoke and it was so)

**3. paupnhr** Green peacock. M: Et viuis tu cum illo: et: regnum tuum cum illis est. {496} (And you live with him, and your kingdom is with those.) 7 gold, fiery feathers.

**4. hdmhiai** Red, fiery gryphon, scales like brass. Dedit illi potestatem in caelus. Potestas illius magna est. Orate. {576} (He gave power to them in heaven. His power is great. Pray.)

**5. kkaaééé** Gold Eagle, circle of feathers in breast, 12 equal squares between four parallel lines, and one on top.[JL: Reminiscent, perhaps, of the breastplate worn by the High Priest of the Israelites, though this may be a stretch.] Magnum est DEVS in Angelis suis. et magna est illorum potestas in Caelis. {642} (Mighty is GOD in his angels, and great is their power in heaven. Pray"

**6. iiéélll** Phoenix or Pelican, size of swan, fiery and sparkling. Bill bent into breast and it bled. [18º SR/Rosicrucianism] M: Nuncius tuus est magnus in caelis. Nuncius {91} = Medieval latin for Gabriel (Messenger of Heaven). Uriel now appears, also with legs like pillars of brass. "This is a mystery. He is here, and not here which was here before. {Dee: ie Michael}"  [Pelican is a common Medieval symbol and can even represent the Passion of Christ and the Eucharist. [here](http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast244.htm) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican#Christianity)

**NOTE: Sir Francis Drake's famous ship was initially called Pelican, and adorned the British halfpenny coin.[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican#Christianity)**

**7. ééllMG+** Fowl with many wings, with Tablet on forehead. [Note: Not birds, but Seraphim have six wings. [Isaiah 6:2](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm)] M: Dedit angelis potestatem in lumine Calei. (He gave power to his angels in the splendor of heaven.) (Geburah/Hod—pillar of severity; connecting path M, water, Hanged Man. Note Mem as first letter of Michael.) M again appears w legs of brass. 

M: Et Coniunxit illos DEV in unum. {307} (And God joined them into one.)

Baskets fly up, vanish, heaven appears. Michael tells Uriel to expound the Mysteries (this seems his job). Dee asks for perfect knowledge and Understanding (Da'ath and Binah). They leave the two to contemplate it for 15 minutes, then return. 

In Enochian, these seven Heptagonal names may be: 

<center>
<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">ZllRHia</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">aZCaacb</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">paupnhr</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">hdmhiai</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">kkaaeee</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">iieelll</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">eellMG+</p>
</center>

7 diverse (multiple?) crosses and 7 letters: 7 seats of the One and everlasting God. 7 angels proceeding from every letter and Cross so formed.

This outer name (on gold plates) is: GALETHOG

Enochian:

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">GALETHOG</p></center>


Substance: FATHER

Form: SON

Inwardly: HOLY GHOST

[Note: All seven letters contain cross or cross/circle {Rose-Cross?} motifs, EXCEPT "XE," unless X is taken as a cross. These seem perhaps some kind of Cross/Circle permutations.  ]

Every letter contains an angel of brightness, comprehending the 7 inward powers of God (holy ghost) known to none but himself. Sufficient BOND [Dee calls emphasis to this] to urge all Creatures to life or Death, or anything else contained in the world. Banishes wicked, expels evil spirits, qualifies water, strengthens just, exalts righteous, destroys Wicke. 1 in 7, Twice in 3 (i.e. 2 x 3 + 1). Refer the numbers to upper circle. 

[Begin Duquette.

Combining the seven names of the outer ring with the seven sigils revealed within, we get:

Galas (+G5 sigil)

Gethog (A+25 sigil)

Thaoth (+oL sigil)

Horon (XE sigil)

Innon (oT sigil — note OTO / Operating Thetan)

Aaoth (HoT sigil)

Galethog (Tog sigil)

Taken together, we receive the "Supreme God Name of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth"

[NOTE: The legs like Pillars of Brass most likely represent Boaz and Jachin, the pillars of Solomon and initiation into the Western mysteries, particularly Masonry. They stood on the porch of the First Temple, and were taken to Babylon by the Chaldeans; they of course also later appear in the High Priestess card for Gimel, initiating to Kether. All of these (even Masonry—how long do the pillars go back?) antedate the Enochian revelations [Wait, no. see below.]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaz_and_Jachin The message here seems to be of Michael and Uriel acting as Initiators into the Mysteries. The pillars were 18 cubits {27 feet) high and 12 cubits (18 feet) in circumference {5.7 ft diameter}.

[History of pillars](http://phoenixmasonry.org/history_of_the_two_pillars.htm)

"Also around 1450 the will of a mason from Beverley gives a tantalising glimpse into the emergence of masonic regalia. An inventory of John Cadeby's possessions mentions several zonas, or girdles. Two were silver mounted, and one of these had the letters B and I in the middle, indicating Boaz and Jachin,the twin pillars of Solomon's Temple.[34] He also owned a writing table and six English books, making him comfortably well-off and literate.[35]" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry) From  John Yarker, The Arcane Schools, Manchester 1909, pp341-342
]

[Also note Crowley's similar use of a bird code in "The Heart of the Master". The birds used there are:

Phoenix: AL

Ibis: ABRAHADABRA
Vulture: MU}
