Following are notes on the "Five Books of Mystery" (Sloane 3188), covering December 22, 1581 to May 23, 1583. These *libers* begin with an abortive attempt at scrying using Barnabas Saul and proceed immediately into the successes attained as Edward Kelley (originally referred to as Edward Talbot) arrives at Mortlake. They detail the reception of the Enochian temple furniture, and precede the records reproduced in *A True and Faithful Relation*.

**Dee/Kelley as Breaking Bad**

There is a spirit, named Lundrumguffa using you who seketh your destruction, in the hatred of
men, in the hurt of thy goods. Discharge him to morrow with Brymstone.187 He haunteth thy howse,
and seketh the destruction of thy dowghter. His pretence was to haue maymed thee in thy Sholder the
last night, and long ago. Yf thow do not dischardg him to morrow, he will hurt, both thy wife and thy
dowghter.188
He is here now.189
Giue him a generall discharge from your familie and howse. **He will seke Sauls death, who is
accursed.190**

Δ: I know no means, or art to do this by. For I did burn in flame of Brymstone, Maherion his name
and Character, whan I fownd Saul priuilie dealing with him (which manner of wicked dealing I had
oft forbydden him) and yet he cam after, and wold haue carryed Saul away quick: as Robert Hilton,
George,191 and other of my howse can testify.
UR: The cursed will come to the cursed.
Δ: I beseche you to discharge him: and to bynde him somwhere far of, as Raphael did (for Thobias
sake) with the wycked spirit Asmodeus.
UR: But Thobias did his part.192 Art is vayne, in respect of God his powre. Brymstone is a mean.

# Secundus

**LIber Secundus** pertains completely to the reception of the Sigillum Dei {110} Aemaeth {49!} = {159 - is there a way to spell so it = 156? Or is 9 simply the inversion of 6?}, the seven-fold seal that forms the basis of the Enochian furniture.

An earlier version of the Sigillum Dei appears in **Liber iuratus**, a 13th or 14th century grimoire colloquially referred to as the "Sworn Booke," spuriously attributed to Honorious, the son of Euclid. As Euclid died three centuries before the birth of Christ, such an authorial attribution boggles the mind until we remember that Medieval writers often attributed their works to historical personages as a way not only to associate their works with a known stream of thought, and claim prestige thereby, but also as a way of preserving anonymity in a hostile religious climate. The vast number of Hermetic works attributed to "Hermes Trismegistus" are a perfect example of this authorial tradition. A more recent example would be the collective use of the name ["Luther Blissett"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Blissett_(nom_de_plume)) by European leftist activists in the 1990s.

The **Liber iuratus** version of the seal is made by constructing "first a circle whose diameter is three fingers, because of the three cross-nails of the Lord, or five fingers because of the five wounds of Christ, or seven for the seven sacraments, or nine for the nine orders of angels, but usually five fingers will suffice. Then make a second within this circle, let it be a distance from the first two grains because of the two Tablets of the Law of Moses, or three grains because of the persons of the Trinity" ([here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigillum_Dei)). [Note that this version also centers on the word EL - Al - Liber Al.]

[(PDF of Sworn Book here)](http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/grimoire/grimoireofhonorius.pdf)

<center><img src="http://www.esotericarchives.com/juratus/aemeth3.jpg"></center>

One of the oldest European grimoires, the Sworn Book is allegedly the condensation of knowledge produced at a conference of operative magicians, and contains 93 chapters—93 being a number of immense importance to Aleister Crowley's Thelema as enumerating to both "Thelema" (will) and "Agape" (love) in Greek gematria, and therefore forming a mathematical signature of his formula of "Love under Will." Present-day Thelemites greet each other with the salutation "93" and speak of the socio-magical milieu surrounding Crowley's system as the "93 Current." The chapters cover the range of classical magical techniques, from finding treasure to conjuring demons. Like many medieval grimoires (which it perhaps formed the key influence for), the Sworn Book purports to be a manual of summoning "perverse Spirits of Darkness," and therefore demands ritual purity and Christian piety as prerequisites for use. This method of operation—long theurgic preparation before goetic conjuration—forms the basic magic theory of medieval European magic. Though Dee and Kelley [c/a] did not attempt goetic conjuration during their sessions, they followed the same protocol; copies of Dee's pre-session prayers to Jesus—his "Fundamental Obeisance" and others—remain extant. The approach remains consistent even into the 20th century, albeit in the more modern form of Crowley's insistence on attaining to the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (the theurgic Magnum Opus par excellance) before attempting other works of magic. The approach breaks down only with the chaos magick insistence on the non-reality of gods and spirits as anything other than constructions of human belief; outside of this postmodern approach, there is little shift in magical procedures throughout the second Millennium.

Like the Dee manuscripts, the Sworn Book was part of the initial Sloane materials that formed the basis of the British Library. One version thereof—Sloane MS 313—is directly from the library of John Dee, and contains notes in his handwriting ([here](http://www.esotericarchives.com/juratus/juratus.htm)). 

(Peterson: "John Dee, in his Mystical Experiments, was originally told to use a version found in one of his books. Dee consulted several sources, and consulted the angels to resolve the discrepancies. This prompted them to detail an almost totally new version of the Sigillum Dei. One of Dee's sources was apparently Sl.313. Roberts and Watson, in their 1990 John Dee's Library Catalogue, pg. 168, identify Sloane 313 as being one of Dee's manuscripts. They give it catalog number DM70, and note, "On fol.9 (originally the first leaf, fol.1-8 having been misbound) is [Dee's ladder symbol] and, very faint, 'Fragmentum Magicum', which may be in Dee's hand. At the foot is 'Sum Ben: Jonsonij liber'."")

[This begs more research - I believe it is mentioned later by the spirits.]

The seal would re-appear in the 20th century as the seal of Aleister Crowley's A.'.A.'., where it is explicitly connected with the goddess BABALON, who appears at the very end of the Spirit Diaries. Both BABALON and the Seal make repeated appearances in *The Vision and the Voice*.

### On Astrology

James A. Eshelman's use of astrology to refine the analysis of Enochian visions, as shown in *Visions & Voices*, is immensely useful in winnowing out "ambient" astral information from the content of the visions themselves. While we have imprecise times and dates for the workings, we may be able to reconstruct some of this approach to Dee and Kelley's sessions.

As far as dates: Elias Ashmole on dates of “2nd Book” (is this Secundus or a section of Secundus)? states: Between March 21 - April 28 1582, records are wanting. Michael angry Dee has been slack on the 28th. Ashmole suggests that actions were on March 21 and April 28, and between them not much happened—some kind of falling out between Dee and Kelley which was reconciled.  

Location: Mortlake is located at 51n28, 0w16

Charts with approximated times will be included with each action. These are imprecise as we don't have the right time ranges. Where available, times will be guessed from the records (i.e. in Action Six, the Dee and Kelley ask the angels if they can leave for dinner at a certain point).

Charts will be drawn using Sidereal astrology (Fagan/Bradley calculation), for the simple reason that Tropical is not accurate.

### On Angelic Cryptography

The forty characters are obviously cryptography. The question is: What's the code? Each white creature gives some variation on a letter/number combination—Roman letters, although Dee later annotated *Secundus* to suggest that these letters be changed to Enochian characters. The following codes *may* be successfully applied (if we work backwards from *The Vision and the Voice*):

- Transliterations of Latin words into English words into Enochian words (using Laycock) and adding Hebrew Qabalistic analysis. 

[For instance: An angel in Action Six states "Regnabit Iniquitas pro tempore." = "Wickedness will rule for a time." In Enochian, wickedness = BABALON. Time = CAPIMAO; Rule = BOGPA, SONF. Babalon bogpa capimao. (Or thereabouts.) The key, however, is that in Qabalah, Time = Saturn, and Saturn = Binah, the sphere of Babalon, who is the Queen of the City of the Pyramids (Binah). So literally "Regnabit Iniquitas pro tempore" = "Wickedness will rule for a time" may = "Babalon reigns in the City of Pyramids."]
 
- Associations of the colors, functions and actions of the angels to Qabalah
- Hebrew Qabalah and Gematria, in comparison with:
- Enochian Gematria
- Latin Qabalah Simplex
- Astrological data.
- Comparison with the rest of the Dee material.
- Comparison with Elizabethan cryptography techniques in general. (Walsingham.)

## Sixth Action (March 1582)—"40 White Creatures of Sigillum Dei"

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9LB2u4D.gif"></center>

*Dramatis Personae.* Dee, Kelley, Michael, Uriel, Semiel, and the 40 White Creatures.

(Titles in quotes are mine.) This action contains missing pages. 

Michael (Fortitudio Dei) appears, along with Uriel (who is clearly subservient to Michael in their social interactions); he later calls Semeliel (Dee note—"this etymology as though he were the secretary for the Name of God") as a subservient angel. He tells the two that nothing is cut from the Church of God, and that the two are blessed among the Saints. But that Kelley will be separated from temptation.

Angels will separate Dee & Kelley from the impure. Kelley has committed idolatry, but they will right him. 

The seal is now revealed—the "true Circle of his eternity comprehending all virtue."

The forty white creatures appeared one by one, announcing the characters around the Sigillum Dei Aemeth. They all appeared as children, in long, white silk robes.

Michael appeared over all of them, became giant with two legs like pillars of brass, and drew a sword of fire over all 40 of their heads. This caused an earthquake, and they all fell to their knees; Michael now called the angel Semiael to explain the Great Seal. Uriel also fell to his knees before the might of Michael's sword; as Michael swung his flaming sword, flaming fire like lightning also flashed "with all" of the forty white creatures. 

Each of the forty White Creatures steps forward in turn, kneeling and unveiling a number/letter combination on their breast.

Latin Qabalah Simplex values of phrases are listed in {} brackets after Latin phrases. LQS is, I believe, a creation of James A. Eshelman and is simply a matter of assigning numerical values in sequence to the Roman alphabet (i.e. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on to end of sequence). Values ere here calculated using [Gerard del Campo's gematria program.](http://test.thelemistas.org/en/Tools/gematria?system=LatinSimplex) I believe there is a Latin Qabalah Simplex basic Sepher 500 published in *Black Pearl* but we so far have not tabulated these values to any other phrases, this remains for future work.

**Note:** In most depictions of Dee's Sigillum, the letters are listed in English. In the footnotes of Liber Secundus Dee stipulates that some of these letters are in Enochian. However it is not clear if all of these letters were given in Enochian, as some (see 4/T) have specific designs that are neither English or Enochian, and yet others are given in "Roman" letters. It seems that here a purist Enochian magician would do well to re-construct the Sigillum from each entry in *Liber Secundus*. 

Translations to 18/o are from Google Translate; past that are Joseph Peterson's. 

**4/T [Gisg].** Gold character in silk-covered breast. (The T is a specific design, see th book.) 40: "It liveth and multiplieth forever: Blessed be his name." Michael: "Place that in first place. It is the name of the Lord." Vanishes in fire.

It seems Dee later went back after the reception of the Enochian language and may have noted that these letters could be changed to Enochian.] Clap of thunder appearance. "Praise God, for his name is reverent." Michael: "Deus Deus Deus noster, benedictus es nunc et semper: Amen." {498} (May God, our God, and blessed art thou, now and forever, Amen.) Repeat after Michael x 3. Fire came out of stone (?) on opening of breast. M: "The number of his name, and knowledge: Lo, this it is, 9. Behold, it is but one, and it is Marvelous."

**22/o [Med].** Round tablet in forehead. M: Et non est finis in illo. {216} (And there is no end in him.) Benedictus es tu Deus. {198} (Blessed art Thou, O God.) He flies away like round rainbow knit together at ends. (Samekh? Chokmah?) [Repeated round symbolism.]

**20/a [Un].** Pure gold graven deep. [Why is A not in triangle in Sigillum??] M: Angeli a nomine tuo procident Domine. Tu es primus O Halleluyah. {556} Angels, one at thy name they shall fall down, O Lord. You are the first O Halleluyah. One angel left standing while all others fall: Sword comes from mouth, point is triangle, in midst is small a (a in triangle), "Et Numerus tuus viuit in caeteris" {364}(And the number of the rest of your lives). Goes away with great lightning covering rest of the world. M: "Nomen illius est nobiscum." {253} (His name is with us)

**14/n [Drux].** One n on breast (14). On back very many n's. M: Creasti tu domine Angelos tuos ad Gloriam tuam. {413} (To the glory of the Angels, didst thou, my lord your crease.). Et te primus Creauit Deus. {248} (And you first , God created). Flies up like star.

M: Et Creata sunt et pereunt in Nomine tuo. {378} (And they were created , and are lost in the name of thy God.) Falls down in dust unto the earth, white garment flies up like white smoke, white thing flies out his body. "Surgit Innocentia ad faciem Dei." {238} (Rises innocence to the face of God)

Michael over them with sword again, which lightens. Speaks, stops, fire flies from mouth. "Innocentium Nomina, et sanguinem vidisti Domine a Terra, et Iustus es in operibus tuis." {816} (The names of Innocent , and the blood by the earth as seen, O Lord , and Thou art just, in thy works.)

M: "Non est illi numerus. Omnia pereunt a facie Dei, et a facie Terrae." {501} (There is no number. All will perish from the face of God, and from the face of the earth.)

**18/o [Med].** Steps forth like water running round about him: "O benedictum Nomen tuum Domine. Numerus perijt cum illis." {533} (Oh, blessed be the name of thy Lord . The number perished with them.) Vanishes, great water remains overall. M: "Lux manet in tenebris. Gloriosum est Nomen tuum." {476} (The light remains in the dark. Glorious is Thy name.)

May you come with your number, O one forever. Departs into air as if on a ladder. M: Linguis suis cognouerunt eum {317} (They recognized him by their tongues).

**l [Ur]/8.** All: Benedictus est qui sic et sic est {298}. (Blessed is he who is so and so), throwing into air three cornered cutting boards (for food) in gold. On one side of each is marked a isosceles triangle with cross in it and four dots in inner corners (see book). One comes out, with transparent body, L in eyes, 8 on forehead. All: Et es verus in operibus tuis {300}. (And you are true in your works.) Vanishes in flame.
