The inner and social planets have here completely shifted from the actions recorded in *Secundus*. Note the buildup in Fixed Air as opposed to Mutable Water in the *Secundus* actions.

Michael appears in flaming chair. Dee and Kelley will be joined as one man, united in mind. (Third Mind.) **This is critical to understanding this materialâ€”particularly the later wife-swapping. Angelic logic perhaps.**

He calls Ese and Iana (Daughters of Light - Venus and Luna?) They appear (two little women); one holds up a Table which glows terribly so that stone is covered with mist. "From these they were created (I created), and these are their names.)

"Numerus Primus."
