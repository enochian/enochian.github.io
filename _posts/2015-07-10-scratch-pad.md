Random notes and scraps to include in the book.

- Define clearly? What is a magician? What is an Adept? Somebody who reflects and turns the wheel of the age, who changes the deep psyche of humanity, the collective unconcious, in a way no artist can.

- Will Self's comments on unhealthy obsession with Revelation in his introduction to the pocket edition

- There are 91 governors of the Aethyrs, the same as AMN, Amen. Weren't there 91 days in Crowley's 9=2 initiation?

- Tying Crowley's use of Enochian to view the dawning of the New Aeon with material in the Spirit Diaries. L (the original technical designation of the Book of the Law, "Liber L vel Legis," before Achad found the 31 key and it was retitled "Liber Al") is the central character on the Holy Table of Practice. Kelley's later transmission from "lying spirits" who tell him that Jesus is not God and transmit a kind of modern New Age/New Aeon doctrine that sounds like Thelema. Crowley's claim to be reincarnation of Kelley.  

- Use BABALON as a central character / framing device: BABALON as superconsciousness, Binah, the Next New Way On. That this is perhaps what is trying to communicate through Dee/Kelley/Crowley/Neuberg: This potentially radically liberatory force. Bring in cult of Inanna (Sumeria)/Ishtar, the Goddess, Parsons' *Book of BABALON*? Peter Grey *Red Goddess*

Crowley's review of Charlotte Fell-Smith's bio of Dee, from *The Equinox, Vol. 1, No. 3*, written *as* Kelley:

JOHN DEE.  BY CHARLOTTE FELL SMITH.  Constable and Co. 10"s." 6"d." net.<br>
   It is only gracious to admit that this book is as good as could possibly<br>
have been produced on the subject ___ the publishes are cordially invited<br>
to quote the last fourteen words, and now I can finish my sentence ___ by a<br>
person totally ignorant of the essence thereof.<br>
   Dee was an avowed magician; Miss Smith is an avowed intellectual prig.<br>
So she can find nothing better to do than to beg the whole question of the<br>
        9  To "take Pansil" is to vow obedience to these Precepts.<br>
        10 I do not propose to dilate on the moral truth which Ibsen has so<br>
          long laboured to make clear: that no hard and fast rule of life<br>
          can be universally applicable.  Also, as in the famous case of<br>
          the lady who saved (successively) the lives of her husband, her<br>
          father, and her brother, the precepts clash.  To allow to die is<br>
          to kill --- all this is obvious to the most ordinary thinkers.<br>
          These precepts are of course excellent general guides for the<br>
          vulgar and ignorant, but you and I, dear reader, are wise and<br>
          clever, and know better.<br>
validity of Dee's "actions," and that although she admits that the Book of<br>
Enoch is unintelligible to her.  Worse, she retails the wretched slanders<br>
about me current among those who envied me.  I was certainly "wanted" for<br>
coining.  I happened to have found the trick of making gold at a very early<br>
age, but had not the sense to exploit it properly; and when I got any sense<br>
I got more sense than to waste time in such follies.  The slander that I<br>
deluded Dee is as baseless.  Again and again I tried to break with him, to<br>
show him how utterly unreliable it all was.  Only his more than paternal<br>
{310} kindness for me kept me with him.  God rest him; I hear he has been<br>
reincarnated as W. T. Stead.<br>
   For one thing I do most seriously take blame, that my training was too<br>
strong for my power to receive spiritual truth.  For when the Holy Angels<br>
came to instruct me in the great truths, that there is no sin, that the<br>
soul passes from house to house, that Jesus was but man, that the Holy<br>
Ghost was not a person, I rejected them as false.  Ah! have I not paid<br>
bitterly for the error?  Still, the incarnation was not all loss; not only<br>
did I attain the Grade of Major Adept, but left enough secret knowledge (in<br>
an available form) to carry me on for a long while.  I am getting it back<br>
now; with luck I'll be a Magister Templi soon, if I can only get rid of my<br>
giant personality.  You may say, by the way, that this is hardly a review<br>
of a book on my old master, silly old josser!  Exactly; I never cared a<br>
dump for him.  He was just a text for my sermon then; and so he is now.<br>
                                            EDWARD KELLEY.

Some unsorted original writing:

“The Vision and the Voice stands alone in the world’s spiritual literature as a singularly elegant fusion of religious doctrine. It represents a kind of calculus of religious concepts, an advanced mathematics of magic and mysticism, both subsuming and overthrowing the world’s religious symbolism.”

When confronted with the immense complexity of Enochian, an immediate question may be: Why? Why complexify spirituality to this degree? Does this not represent a massive case of missing the forest for the trees?

In the 21st century, many of us have a very limited (and limiting) view of spirituality; most intelligent moderns have discarded the dogma of the Church and subscribed to atheism and materialism. In this context, spirituality is often contextualized as a way to momentarily “feel good”—a yoga class, a seminar on positive thinking.  In contrast to this, in the Enochian corpus we are confronted by a form of spirituality that more closely suggests high-level computer programming than anything else.

Why bother with something this complex? Isn’t spirituality about basic common sense? Isn’t just being a good person, being kind to our neighbors, and perhaps being against war and abusive businesses enough? 

It is this sentimental attitude towards spirituality—that living a good life, as measured by the social standards of the day, is enough—that is directly challenged not only by Enochian, but by many of the more structured world religions, from Catholicism to Vajrayana Buddhism to Vedanta. Spirituality is not concerned with sentimental “following the rules” of the average individual, who believes that if they follow the rules of society they are a “good” person and therefore spiritually pure. 

We can find a perfectly clear refutation of this attitude in the Enochian Aethyrs themselves—specifically in the 20th Aethyr, KHR, as explored by Aleister Crowley and Victor Neuberg in 1909. Here, the Lamb of God or Agnus Dei, a traditional image of Christ as “sacrificial lamb,” appears as the “Great Deceiver” and chief of the lying spirits, drunk on the blood of the saints. The lamb, which appears at the top of the Wheel of Fortune, the illusory whirlings of life, is shown as distracting the sentimental from reaching the center of the wheel—distracting these individuals by its seemingly “pure and white” nature. This, Crowley explains, shows that sentimentality is a parody of intuition. It is  a simulation of the actual intuitive promptings of the soul—prompted by the weakness of the body and animal instincts, and leading to the corrupt doctrines of sin and vicarious atonement, rather than the heroic path of the initiate, who must overcome these illusions by overcoming their mind and embracing emptiness.
