Following is pure linguistic data and Qabalistic correspondences for the Enochian alphabet itself.

The characters, from Casaubon:

###Astrological Correspondences

The above correspondences were formulated by Crowley (not the G.D.) by attributing 16 of the Enochian letters to the 16 signs of Geomancy, and the remaining 5 to the 5 elements. The updated numerations are from Jim Eshelman.

The G.D.'s original correspondences are from MS. Harley 6282 ("A Treatise on Angel Magic" from Dr. Rudd) and elsewhere. Crucially, Crowley switched the attribution of Gemini and Virgo from Fam and Graph to Graph and Fam, though the original inaccurate order is recorded in Aethyr 30.

Also, Crowley mistakenly attributes Mals and Ged to Leo and Cancer instead of Cancer and Leo in his notes, despite knowing the right attribution.

Crowley often mistakes Leo and the Dragon's Head in his own handwriting.

###Gematria

Crowley used the math Un (A) = Taurus = Vau = 6, working backward from the attribution of BABALON to 156. However, neither the Enochian BABALON (wicked) or BABALOND (harlot) equals 156 in Enochian gematriaâ€”only in Hebrew and Greek. In Enochian gematria, then, BABALON is 280. Eshelman suggests that the best approach is direct transliteration into Hebrew or Greek with some fudge factor (I'm not sure I understand this. V&V pp. 58-59. Eshelman also completely rejects New Aeon English Qabalah in favor of direct transliteration of English into Hebrew.)
