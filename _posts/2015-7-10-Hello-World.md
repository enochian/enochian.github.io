This is a research blog about the Elizabethan scientist, spy and magus [Dr. John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee); his compatriot Edward Kelley, a forger, psychic and oft-times Goetic conjuror; and the Enochian magical system that they together channeled over the better part of a decade.

Enochian is a massively complex subject—the Calculus of magick. It has been both at the heart of the Rosicrucian thought-stream and simultaneously just outside of the reach of most Rosicrucian students. Though it formed the core of the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley's Thelema and the work of the rocket scientist Jack Parsons, all of these magicians only touched small parts of the system, and then only through the reconstructive lens of Golden Dawn founder MacGregor Mathers. Recent scholarly work—for instance, that of Donald Laycock, Stephen Skinner and others—has made huge strides in uncovering Dee and Kelley's original material.

Early in 2005 I wrote an article on John Dee for the site [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2015/02/19/john-dee-was-the-real-life-mer.html) that explored his life and magic; this project spilled out of the confines of an article to become the ebook [The Angelic Reformation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SRMFDAK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00SRMFDAK&linkCode=as2&tag=magickme-20&linkId=VOO5MAZJNYNEY5SC), essentially a Master's thesis on Dee's impact on world culture. I am now expanding this smaller work into a full-length book for Inner Traditions/Bear & Co.

This site will form a scratch pad and working notes for the book, as I dig into the massive task of reassembling Dee's immensely complex life and even more complex work, and, ultimately, the message of the Enochian angels themselves.
