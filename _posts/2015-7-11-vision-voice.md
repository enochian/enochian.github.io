Assessing Aleister Crowley (Frater O.M.) and Victor Neuberg's (Frater Omnia Vincam) work with the 30 Aethyrs in 1909, Algeria, from November 23 to December 19 of that year. This working elucidated and developed the Book of the Law (1904) and Thelemic Holy Books (1907), particularly *Liber VII*, and firmly established the Thelemic cosmology that would later inform the O.T.O. and Gnostic Mass. Two years later, the recieved book *Liber Cheth* further developed the iconography of BABALON:
<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">BABALON</p></h3></center>
The Scarlet Woman, who also figures centrally in Revelation, appeared to Dee and Kelley after the wife-swapping incident that ended their partnership, and  appeared to Crowley for the first time in the Algerian sessions. BABALON is not a part of the Golden Dawn Enochian material that Crowley drew on for these sessions, although he may well have read of the Dee and Kelley apparition in the Sloane folios in the British Library(?); Revelation, of course, formed the core of Crowley's psychology as the Bible was his sole reading material during his adolescence in the Plymouth Bretheren, leading him to identify totally with the Beast, the consort of BABALON in Revelation. Crowley thereafter formulated BABALON as the center of his sex-magical or Tantric system, overlaying the Beast/BABALON mythos to the technical sexual magick afforded him only later, in June 1912, upon his admission to the IXº O.T.O. by Theodor Reuss.

Crowley, according to his *Confessions*, had read Casaubon before embarking on his Algerian trip with Neuberg, and had seen Dee and Kelley's scrying implements in the British Museum. Crowley's opinion of Kelley's transmissions is high:

"It is not a jargon; it has a grammar and syntax of its own. It is very much more sonorous, stately and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit, and the English translation, though in places difficult to undersatdn, contains passages of sustained sublimity that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass. To condemn Kelly as a cheating charlatan—the accepted view—is simply stupid. If he invented Enochian, and composed this superb prose, he was at worst a Chatterton with fifty times that poet's ingenuity and five hundred times his poetical genius." – *The Confessions*

##The Aethyrs
<center><img src="http://img44.xooimage.com/files/d/7/0/roue_aethyrs-d1e1f7.jpg"></center>

30 consecutive Aethyrs are outlined by Kelley—as given to Dee and Kelley on July 13, 1584 by the angels Ile and Gabriel (the latter being the same angel that disclosed the Qu'ran to the prophet Mohammed). These aethyrs are either "dominion extending in ever widening circles without and beyond the Watchtowers of the Universe," the cube of the Universe formed by the four tables; or aires simply means "climes" and they pertain to different parts of the world. Either they are spiritual landscapes, terrestrial locations or, somehow, both; Crowley and Neuberg used them as the former and not the latter.

Two mappings of the Aethyrs to the tree are given—one by the Golden Dawn, and another by a second order Golden Dawn schema mentioned in the 9th Aethyr. The first of these, which is elegant enough, is that the Aethyrs map the ten sephiroth as repeated in sequence in the latter 3 of the 4 Qabalistic worlds—Yetzirah, Briah and Atziluth, or the Astral, Causal and Spiritual planes in Theosophical language—skipping Assiah totally, as the Aethyrs are concentric spheres outwith the cube of the physical universe (Malkuth) depicted in the 30th Aethyr. This scheme is:

##Operating Procedures

Crowley's initial experiments were undertaken by modifying the 19th Call for each Aethyr, and then scrying the Spirit Vision—astral travel or willed imagination—which is outlined in the grade papers of the Golden Dawn. More precise methods, involving prepartory pentagrams and grade signs, are given in his later paper *Liber Chanokh*. None of this is found in Dee and Kelley; they are Golden Dawn methods. 9 years passed between his initial investigation of Aethyrs 30 and 29 and the Algerian experiment; this Crowley attributes to having increased his Grade or spiritual maturity to now be able to handle the visions. This factoring of the observer and their responses to messages, as well as changing information, perhaps, may be applied in reverse to Dee and Kelley. Crowley's line, again from the *Confessions*, is: "Anyone might use the Key for any Aethyr he chose, but he would either get no vision at all or expose himself to deception, and that probably of the deadly dangerous kind."

![Bou Saada](http://famouswonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Bou-Saada.jpg "Bou Saada")
<center><sub>The desert near Bou Saada</sub></center>

In Bou Saada, Algeria, Crowley employed a "great golden topaz (set in a Calvary cross of six squares, made of wood, painted vermillion) engraved with a Greek cross of five squares charged with the Rose of forty-nine petals." 49 is the number of squares in each Table. (This topaz, I am recalling off the top of my head, was stolen from Sascha Germer by the Solar Lodge in the late 1960s and subsequently lost in a fire at their ranch.) Crowley would scry into this stone physically after reciting the call. This is a marked difference from his earlier "spirit vision" methods; astral travel is essentially willed imagination with eyes closed, while scrying is looking for visuals in a physical object with eyes open. His method at this point was the simply let the Aethyr itself "overshadow" his senses as he drifted into deep trance—bringing the Aethyr to him instead of going to it. In doing this (according to Eshelman) Crowley worked to maintain an observer's perspective (in Yetzirah) instead of going fully into Samadhi upon the contents of the Aethyr. He describes this approach in the 20th Aethyr.

Recieved information was later checked by Qabalistic correspondence, Crowley's favored check against self-delusion. For Crowley, if a "spirit" code transmit accurate Qabalistic codes, and in particular if it demonstrated that it knew more Qabalah than him, then his connection to the other side was valid. When dealing with the Otherworlds, this was the equivalent of a Masonic handshake or, as we might say today, a valid password or SSH key. Later magical students, more influenced by pop psychology, like Crowley's once-secretary Israel Regardie, would have explained this by suggesting that Crowley—and, indeed, Kelley—were simply accessing deeper parts of their own brains, portions more advanced than their waking consciousness. [What does modern psychology/neuroscience say about this?]

Dee and Kelley utilized no such tests.

For Crowley, the Enochian visions subsumed *all* prior world religions, mystery cults and esoteric symbolism, all of it ultimately giving way to the incoming Aeon of Horus that had been announced by Aleister and Rose Crowley's 1904 reception of the *Book of the Law* in Cairo. *The Vision of the Voice* far surpasses this book both in length and complexity, and fully elucidates and develops the doctrine of the Aeon, which would inform Crowley's later attempts to formulate Thelema as an organized and terrestrial religion as opposed to something he had seen only while in a visionary state. That the content of Crowley's Enochian visions seem to confirm his own developing philosophy and primacy as a messianic figure immediately makes them suspect, even by Crowley's own standards—writing later, in the "Notes for an Astral Atlas" appendix to *Book 4*, Crowley warns the student that:

"Remember, then, always, but especially when dealing with the Astral Plane, that man's breath stirs the Feather of Truth. What one sees and hears is 'real' in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or created by one's personality... 

"The Magician may go on for a long time being fooled and flattered by the Astrals that he has himself modified or manufactured. Their natural subservience to himself will please him, poor ape!

"They will pretend to show him marvellous mysteries, pageants of beauty and wonder unspeakably splendid; he will incline to accept them as true, for the very reason that they are images of himself idealized by the imagination.

"But his real progress will stop dead. These phantasms will prevent him from coming into contact with independent intelligences, from whom alone he can learn anything new.

"He will become increasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to be attaining one initiation after another. His Ego will expand unchecked, till he seem to himself to have heaven at his feet. Yet all this will be nothing but his fool's face of Narcissus smirking up from the pool that will drown him." [(via)](http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/app3.html)

In many ways, *The Vision and the Voice* marks the high point of Crowley's career as an Adept—now a Magister Templi—of the Golden Dawn system outlined by his mentor Mathers. Post-Algeria, Crowley would be wrapped up in the drama of a new mystery school—the Ordo Templi Orientis or OTO—and concern himself largely with its sexual methods and with instituting Thelema as a religion, with himself as the head. His research progressed along other lines, and administrative manners; however, Crowley the Pure Seeker was never quite so pristine, to be replaced with Crowley the PR Man for the Aeon.

Additionally, Crowley used a Muslim mantra, from Surah 112, while travelling across the desert—this being done to enter receptive mental states, or "purify" himself as he put it, by creating states of absolute physical exhaustion so that his body would not disturb his mind, much like the use of *asana* in Hatha Yoga:

*Qul: Huw-Allahu ahad; Allahu samad; lam yalid wa lam yulad; wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad.* 

This was recited 1,001 times per day, with each recitation followed by a prostration. (1,001 is obviously taken from *1,001 Nights*, translated by Crowley's early hero and role model Richard Burton; it is used in this book to denote an infinitely large number, much as the number 10,000 is used in Buddhist texts. The number is indeed important in Sufism; students of the [Mevlevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevlevi_Order) dervish order must undergo 1,001 days of prayer before becoming a teacher.)

Crowley was now able to penetrate beyond the initial two aethyrs; his progress beyond the 19th was assisted by a specially appointed Angelic guardian; the following aethyrs concerned the equilibriation and then destruction of Crowley's individual self. By the 14th Aethyr, Crowley and Neuberg has climbed the mountain Daleh Addin—this mountain is now called Djebel Chélia or simply Chélia; it was here that Crowley began to have Victor Neuberg sodomize him, as an effort in taboo-breaking and disruption of the personality—Crowley writes (circuitiously, as sodomy was still illegal, a major reason for Crowley's often obfuscatory writing and personal legal troubles) that "I may say that the essence of the matter was that I had hitherto clung to certain conceptions of conduct which, while perfectly proper from the standpoint of my human nature, were impertinent to initiation." This may have assisted visionary states; it may also have been a deep working out of Crowley's own conflict around his sexuality. While homosexuality was not new for him, passive sodomy may have been. This sexual taboo-breaking also occurs in Madimi's request that Dee and Kelley swap wives, perhaps as a way of deeply disrupting the personality in order to open it to further visionary input. As Dee and Kelley eventually did, Crowley writes that he "obeyed my Angel," and turned passive sodomy [was it actually this?] into a means of invoking his Holy Guardian Angel. He would later write in the comfort of his own intellect and literary anonymity in the *Bagh-i-Muattar*, where he becomes much more confident and bombastic. Crowley glyphed this act in later writings as "XIº OTO"—homosexual sex magick—although at the time he had not yet been initiated to OTO.

![Djebel Chelia](http://www.vitaminedz.com/photos/27/27067-djebel-chelia-aures.jpg "Djebel Chélia")
<center><sub>Djebel Chélia as it appears today.</sub></center>

These acts, he wrote, disrupted his personality and undermined his ego totally—he was in a state of psychosis or mania, perhaps. Crowley was now to enter the "City of Pyramids," a landscape informed by the Enochian tablets or rather the Golden Dawn conceit of turning their squares into pyramids, this being the habitation of Masters or non-physical adepts, and given to the task of the Master of the Temple in raising up humanity, in Crowley's case under the planetary aegis of Jupiter or the sphere Chesed. The Queen of the City of Pyramids was now revealed to be BABALON herself, who accepted the blood of the saints here encamped, and to whom they were enjoined to offer their ego totally, under penalty of imperfect initiation and stagnation; similary to Dee and Kelley's account of the "Daughter of Fortitude," BABALON's appearance followed the successful accomplishment of the breaking of sexual taboo.

Now being "abandoned" by his angelic guardian, Crowley was told to call the 10th Aethyr, ZAX, and cross the "Abyss" or separation between God and man, noumenon and phenomenon, the guardian of which was CHORONZON, the "mighty devil" [c] described by Kelley. Crowley was here taking the name "Coronzon" from Casaubon and changing the spelling to Choronzon, potentially so that were the name transliterated into Hebrew, the first letter would be Cheth, "Ch." Crowley's Hebrew transliteration, given in *Sepher Sephiroth*, is ChVRVNZVN, Cheth-Vau-Resh-Vau-Nun-Zayin-Vau-Nun, enumerating to 333 by Gematria. By Greek gematria, 333 also enumerates to the words for "incontinence, dispersion, debauchery and wantonness"—in Hebrewm it also enumerates to AYQ BKR, the Qabalah of the nine chambers, and ShLG, snow (Eshelman adds HChShN, the darknessm and HShChVTCh, the slaughtered). All of this suggests the dispersion of the mind or, as Eshelman puts it, the "Anti-Will."

However, this spelling is one of several things that Casaubon got wrong; Dee's diaries themselves identify this entity as "Coronzom," and this has been corrected in Stephen Skinner's revision of Casaubon. In Enochian letters, this would be:

<center><h2><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">CORONZOM</p></h2></center>

[**NOTE:** This Enochian web font, designed in 1996, is inaccurate. It uses the same character (Don) for Don (R) and Tal (M), a common beginner mistake; they are different characters. See the Enochian alphabet below. This means the final Tal or M is not correct, this would unfortunately have to be done by hand. Then again, maybe it's best not to put a demon's name online.]

<center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Enochian_alphabet.png/550px-Enochian_alphabet.png"></center>

From Dee's diaries (quoted from Eshelman, not Skinner):

*But Coronzon[sic] (for so is the name of that mighty devil), envying man's felicity, and perceiving that the substance of man's lesser part was frail and unperfect in respect to his purer essence, began to assail man, and so prevailed.*

This demon—representing the final chaos of the mind or the reason/discursive ego itself incorrectly attempting to usurp the throne of God or pure, trans-linguistic, transpersonal spiritual intuition ("knowledge is a false crown [i.e. is not Kether though may appear to be to one who has not overcome their ego]")—was evoked into a triangle using the medium of pigeon blood (three pigeons were sacrificed), in operating procedures taken from the *Göetia* or *Lesser Key of Solomon*—Kelley had been rebuked by the Angels for his prior work with Göetia. Neuberg worked as the operator while Crowley himself stood in the triangle, perhaps hoping Neuberg would "exorcise" the Choronzom complex from him totally. Crowley was possessed, broke the circle and attacked Neuberg; Neuberg banished the demon back to the triangle by vibrating the Qabalistic names of God and striking Crowley with his magical dagger. The demon returned to the triangle where it continued to psychologically attack Neuberg until the "energy" in the spilled pigeon blood was depleted. Crowley wrote the name of BABALON in the sand with his ring, and emerged from his possession trance. The ordeal lasted two hours.

Beyond ZAX, the character of the Aethyrs changed. Crowley notes that the original text of the 19th Call reads, at face value, as curse:

"O YE Heavens which dwell in the first Air, yea are mighty in the parts of the Earth, and execute the Judgment of the Highest! Unto you it is said: Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth, and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding to dispose all things according to the Providence of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, and rose up in the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be governed by her parts, and let there be Division in her, that the glory of her may be always drunken, and vexed in itself. Her course, let it run with the Heavens; and as an handmaid let her serve them. One season, let it confound another, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her members, let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one Creature equal with another. The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them forget their Names. The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His buildings, let them become Caves for the beasts of the Field! Confound her understanding with darkness! For why? it repenteth me that I have made Man. One while let her be known, and another while a stranger: because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that is fallen."

In the 9th Aethyr and beyond, and Coronzom overcome, the text appeared to Crowley as a blessing, showing that is only the mind of man which projects evil and disorder upon the pristine perfection of the Universe and, that mind being overcome, there was now nothing but perfection to see. [Elizabethan conception of chaos.] Without an ego, there was now nothing to suffer, and nothing to make suffer. It was years, however, before Crowley could fully assimilate this perspective. As anybody who has tasted heaven through spirtual practice or drugs can tell you, there's always a comedown, and always a morning after. But once you've seen freedom, you can't forget that it exists, and you can begin the work of slowly retraining a lifetime of bad thinking and false perception—*samskaras*, as Hindu meditators would say—to fall in line with the new perspective.

The remaining Aethyrs showed progressive visions of purity and grace, until the sequence ended. (My own experiences with the 30 Aethyrs, repeated in haphazard fashion in 2006 with a group of 7 individuals, can be found in *Ultraculture Journal.*)

##Astrological Factors

Though not calculated or timed by Crowley and Neuberg, James Eshelman later worked to analyze the astrology of each Aethyr calling itself as an attempt to isolate astrological influences on the visions from the actual content of the Aethyrs themselves. This is outside our scope for the present work but will be mentioned when appropriate here. Eshelman notes that the sun was in sidereal Scorpio (tropical Sagittarius) between the 28th and 5th Aethyrs, highly relevant to the sexual/destructive qualities of BABALON. 

##Summary of Method

Here, then, is a summary of the methods used by O.M. and Omnia Vincam:

1. Sensory deprivation and social isolation by remaining in uninhabited desert conditions.
2. Physical exhaustion from crossing desert while making 1,001 prostrations per day.
3. Mental focus and emptiness by making 1,001 recitations of Surah 112 per day.
4. The recitation of the 19th Call, modified for each Aethyr.
5. Physically scrying into a golden topaz, while overshadowed by the Aethyr.
6. Taboo-breaking by homosexual sex magick (passive sodomy).
7. Göetic-style evocation AND invocation with aid of animal sacrifice for material basis.

Methods 1-3 would have formed a powerful separation from anything but the ritual psychotheater generated by methods 4-7; such devices are well known by cults the world over as ways of isolating individuals and removing them from anything but the world view of the cult. While here the cult consisted of only two individuals and the methods self-applied, the techniques are consistent. Within such conditions, and within a shared private universe, Crowley and Neuberg—like Dee and Kelley before them—were able to enter a kind of "virtual reality" generated by their unfettered minds, emerging with one of the most striking literary and religious works, in my opinion, of the 20th century. The prose of *The Vision and the Voice* is the best of Crowley's career, surpassing even the Holy Books; like Kelley's messages from the Angels, it is at once exquisitely sacred and profoundly chilling. Next to Dee and Kelley's own Spirit Diaries, it is the primary document of Enochian magick in practice—while Dee and Kelley received the system, Crowley and Neuberg actually *used* it—or at least used a section of it, namely the 30 Aethyrs, rather than the Holy Table itself (Crowley would use the Tablets in later workings, particularly in combination with the VIIIº OTO or masturbatory sex magick). For this reason, *The Vision and the Voice*, or *Liber 418* as it is technically designated in Crowley's A∴A∴, should be studied alongside Dee and Kelley's work.

Following are analyses of each Aethyr. 

##Sources and Publication History

I will here be referring to the following texts:

Crowley, Aleister, with Victor B. Neuberg and Mary Desti. *The Vision & The Voice, With Commentary and Other Papers. (The Equinox, Vol. IV, No. II).* York Beach: Weiser, 1998.

Eshelman, James A. *Visions & Voices: Aleister Crowley's Enochian Visions With Astrological & Qabalistic Commentary.* Los Angeles: The College of Thelema, 2011.

*The Vision & The Voice* was originally published, uncommented, as the special supplement to *The Equinox*, Vol. I, No. V, 1911. Two sets of commentary were later added by Crowley, which were published in a 1952 edition of *V&V* by Karl Germer, which was again revised by Israel Regardie in 1972, who mixed his own notes in with Crowley's without distinction. The final version was William Breeze's, used here and noted above. The very original text was handwritten by Victor Neuberg in Algeria.

[Breeze edition: Malkuth, Yesod, Hod and Netzach in Malkuth. Also Hod and Netzach on the Tree. I am quite confused by these attributions in Equinox 4.2.]

Suggests incoming of Aeon of Horus; 18º Rose-Croix degree of Scottish Rite. Also the imagery is consistent with the path of Tav (Saturn) leading from Malkuth.

Crystal cube in form of Harpocrates (Malkuth) surrounded by sphere (Aethyrs)—"I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. 'Come unto me' is a foolish word: for it is I that go'"—surrounded by four archangels. Suggests Pentagram ritual. Harpocrates is the center of the 4 archangels—"(This is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein am I as a babe in an egg.)"

New Aeon comes in at Four Quarters, in each of which an Archangel holds a book labelled back and front in Enochian. [Note: The M's are fucked in the font.] The Archangels are in black robes, their wings and armor lined out in white. All this symbolism seems to elaborate the Pentagram Ritual. Tetragrammaton imagery is found throughout.

Crowley, from *Book 4*:

*The formation of the "Yod" is the formulation of the first creative force, of that father who is called "self-begotten", and unto whom it is said: "Thou has formulated thy Father, and made fertile thy Mother". The adding of the "He" to the "Yod" is the marriage of that Father to the great co-equal Mother, who is a reflection of Nuit as He is of Hadit. Their union brings forth the son "Vau" who is the heir. Finally the daughter "He" is produced. She is both the twin sister and the daughter of "Vau". His mission is to redeem her by making her his bride; the result of this is to set her upon the throne of her mother, and it is only she whose youthful embrace can reawaken the eld of the All-Father. In this complex family relationship is symbolised the whole course of the Universe. It will be seen that (after all) the Climax is at the end. It is the second half of the formula which symbolises the Great Work which we are pledged to accomplish. The first step of this is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, which constitutes the Adept of the Inner Order. The re-entry of these twin spouses into the womb of the mother is that initiation described in Liber 418, which gives admission to the Inmost Order of the A∴ A∴ Of the last step we cannot speak.*

Breaking the Maidenhead of Nuit—Uniting of Heh and Vau. That Heh final might partake. From the Golden Dawn 4=7 ritual, the explanation of the Diagram at the Altar:

*This is the symbolic re resentation of THE FALL. For, the Great Goddess who, in the 3=8 Grade was supporting the
Columns of the Sephiroth, in the sign of the 2=9 Grade, being tempted by the Tree of Knowledge (whose branches indeed tend
upward into the Seven Lower Sephiroth, but also tend downward anto the Kingdom of Shells) reached down unto the Qlippoth,
and immediately the Columns were unsupported and the Sephirotic system was shattered, and with it fell ADAM, the MICROPROSOPUS.*

*Then arose the Great DRAGON with Seven Heads and Ten Horns, and the Garden was made desolate, and MALKUTH was cut off from the Sephiroth by his intersecting folds, and linked unto the Kingdom of Shells. And the Seven Lower Sephiroth were cut off
from the Three Supernals in DAATH, at the feet of AIMA ELOHIM.*

*And on the Heads of the Dragon are the Names and Crowns of the Edomite Kings. And because in DAATH was the greatest rise of the Great Serpent of Evil, therefore is there, as it were, another Sephirah, making for the Infernal or Averse Sephiroth, Eleven instead of Ten.*

*And hence were the Rivers of Eden desecrated, and from the Mouth of the DRAGON rushed the Infernal Waters in DAATH. And this is LEVIATHAN, The Crooked Serpent.*

*But between the Devastated Garden and the Supernal Eden, YOD HE VAU HE ELOHIM placed the Letters of THE NAME and THE
FLASHING SWORD that the uppermost part of the Tree of Life might not be involved in the Fall of Adam. And thence it was
necessary that the SECOND ADAM should come to restore all things and that,as the First Adam had been extended on the Cross of
the Celestial Rivers, so the SON should be crucified on the Cross of the Infernal Rivers of DAATH. Yet, to do this, he must descend unto the lowest first, even unto Malkuth and be born of her.*

Comment: The disturbance of Equilibrium caused by the Coming of the Aeon.</center>

Green sky covered with gold stars, dark (Venus/Solar). The imagery is the four beasts of Daniel and Apocalypse, surrounding the throne of the Elders (seen in Aethyr 30), as in ATU XXI and ATU X Rider-Waite. Also the Kerubs of the Elements, following on from the Pentagram Ritual symbolism in Aethyr 30 (Kerubs are seen in Supreme Pentagram Ritual of GD).

Scorpio-Taurus: East-West. Leo-Aquarius: South-North. As if Antares, Regulus and Aldebaran were rising, culminating and setting. Scorpio-Taurus=Nun Vav, NU; + Leo=Teth, NUT, Nuit.

**East:** Eagle-angel/Scorpio/Water/Heh/Understanding, wings hide heaven (the immediate, scary future). Speech reminiscent of ATU XX in Rider-Waite. This is the GD attribution but years later Crowley would re-attribute the Eagle to Air instead of Water, leaving Scorpio.

Chesed absorbed in the Abyss.

**South:** Lion/Leo/Fire/Yod/Wisdom, wounded and perplexed, the Beast 666, Sol in Strength. Wounded masculine of Aeon of Osiris—dying patriarchy?

**West:** Bull/Taurus/Earth/Heh final, white with horns of white and black and gold, scarlet mouth, sapphire eyes, cleaving sky with sword (air, as Taurus itself is attributed to air), lightning and deep clouds of Indigo. Again the YHVH symbolism. The fall of Christianity/Osiris/Mithras. Work of Yesod/2=9 A.A.

**North:** Man/Libra [instead of Aquarius]/Saturn on Great horse with scourge and balances (Libra/Lamed/Justice), black velvet - similar to Death of Apocalypse (Kalki) (Note: Death/Kalki, as is Horus, is "crowned and conquering" in Revelation). Gaze into unconscious to see superconsciousness.

Air as herald of Aquarius/Current of destiny in the body of Nuit. Everything is changed, and it only looks like chaos (CHAOS = Chokmah and a name of the Beast, see Biroco Kaos 14) but it is the skeleton of a new truth. Light consumed in womb of Binah to create itself anew. LVX/INRI:IAO/TARO passwords (see The Wake World)—LVX cross hidden in cubical Swastika. 65, 231, 21, 78. 18º SR?

Glory to the most high god. In Enochian, this is:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">IAIDA</p></h3></center>

Which transliterated in Hebrew is 26, the same as YHVH, the Tetragrammation which is here shown rearranging in this and the previous Aethyr.

BAG= 19, Eve, manifest, show forth.

An invocation of Binah, of the wheel of Time, and foreshadowing of the Abyss/ZAX.

An angel (Hod/Aries) in a sapphire stone suggesting Tiphareth and Path Samekh, with eyes suggesting Binah (the Angel and the Abyss), warding Binah. The end of the illusion of Time. If you come here you must be scarred with sorrow (become 8=3). Unification of opposing sephira—Sun/Moon, Mars/Venus, Saturn/Jupiter. [The entire V&V is Crowley's initiation to Binah.]

The four Watch-Towers of the Elements are *within* Chesed/Jupiter as symbolized by Sapphire (four/Jupiter/stability of universe). Crossed arms of Osiris at Tiphareth before destruction as salt (8=3). 8=3 may make a new Qabalah, but intellectual manipulations are useless for crossing Abyss. 

Enochian writing:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">OLAHO VIRUDEN MAHORELA ZODIREDA! ON PIREDA EXENTASER; ARBA PIRE GAH GAHA GAHAL GAHALANA VO ABRA NA GAHA VELUCORSAPAX.</p></h3></center>

Which is suggested to be part lunar language. Laycock's translation for Regardie:

"For the second time I have beautified those dark Heavens I inhabit! builded there for the Holy Mother of all. The shrine of the spirits existed, exists, and shall exist, wherein it is provided that the Babe of the Abyss [is] enthroned."

Name of warden, by a cipher, is:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">LIXIPSL</p></h3></center>

Originally calculated as Draco Magnus or Mighty Dragon, Nuit/Binah. Breeze notes this should be 552, "Desiderium dierum," 
"Longing for the days." Eshelman gives 491 by Hebrew and 620 by Enochian; he suggests the angel was trolling him by making him dwell on exactly the kind of intellectual bs he had just warned against. Angel says that it is above the three angels of this Aethyr, but that there are four angels in the 30th Aethyr who have none above them (therefore breaking up into the dispersion of Coronzom).

"Face of mother is scarred by nails of devil" = Vau Vau Vau, 666? The number of mankind and also Sol, Tiphareth, below Binah. The seer descends to physically viewing his Rose Cross (rose cross imagery = his scrying equipment).

Core message of Aethyr BAG, which corresponds directly to 3=8 Practicus grade, is that truth comes from intuition, not intellect. The transcendence of the intellect (HOD) which is the primary task of the Practicus.

Passwords of all grades (55 + 45 + 36 + 28 + 21 + 15 + 10) = 210 = NOX, the Word of the Abyss.

Comment: Hecate appears—her son, the son of a virgin, a magus, is to bring the Aeon to pass. And she, the herald, her function fulfilled, withdraws within her mystic veil.</center>

522 = Vau-Vau-Mem = 21, mystery of ATU XVIII, exaltation of Venus in Pisces (seems doubtful).

Eshelman: Leo Taurus Taurus = 7+1+1 = 9, Yesod (Moon).

If the paths truly are attributed by Sephira/4 Worlds as Eshelman suggests, there seems to be a lot of reflecting of higher worlds into lower (similar to how grades mirror the lessons of their reversals, i.e. 3=8/8=3). 

Lunar and Venusian imagery (silver, huntress, etc—hence Hecate). Path Gimel (Hecate, Luna). Luna as the Sensorium, man's spiritual state in relation to perceived phenomena. This seems to track lunar/huntress imagery *across* the tree—Venus/Luna/Gimel/Sagittarius. Specifically: Gimel, Yesod, Qoph. This triple attribution of the moon = [Threefold Goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)) (Mother/Maiden/Crone, Hecate, the outer manifestation of BABALON/Binah, etc. Binah=3.) Imagery here subsumes all lunar. 

War of Aires and elements (I seem to remember that somebody somewhere actually took this to mean there was a war between angels of the Aethyrs and the ones of the Tablets; Crowley here suggests it to mean that coefficients of Circle and Square must be commensurable—squaring of circle, etc?) Eshelman: Tablets as interface between cubical material universe and Aethyrs. (Their letters form governors of Aethyrs; suggesting perhaps tablets as faces of cube projecting the Aethyrs OUTWARD like a holographic projection? War as Ruach vs Neshamah.)

Rainbow path of Qesheth, Rainbow of Promise, Archer's Bow of Sagittarius = Solar light of Tiphareth *reflecting on* the lunar waters of Yesod (therefore creating the Path blending of the two Sephira); those who walk the path successfully become *Hodos Chamelionis* in G.D.

Kamailos = camel/rope across abyss. Angel of Daleth/love of Supernals balancing Path Gimel (similar to Samekh balancing Peh). Calling to hounds in the Lunar Language.

This symbols appears in Adeptus Minor initiation of GD in center of floor of Vault of the Adepti and also on the head of the Pastos. It is a symbol of Venus and now BABALON—and, of course, there are 49 Calls in total, 49 days in the Bardo between death and reincarnation in Tibetan Buddhism, 49 Tables given to Dee and Kelley by the angels (see DeSalvo, *Decoding the Enochian Secrets*, making this a most crucial number. 49 is also HGYAL, the Intelligence of Venus, MT, the Rod of Aaron, and many more. And of course is 7 x 7 (see the Seal of Babalon).

Art card/Sagittarius (Cauldron). Hecate does not understand why BABALON needs the blood of the Adepts. Pearls = Masters of Temple secreted by Binah around specks of dust. Dragon as mask of Kephra in ATU XVIII. Black Dragon stage of alchemy (Portal ritual). Stone as code word for intimate union. Da'ath=Knowledge=Gnosis? (!) 

Echoes of Liber LXV and VII. Phenomenon of destruction of phenomenon for M.T.; kisses... The word of the Aeon is MAKHASHANAH (418, a blind for ABRAHADABRA). And to call Hecate (Yorke reconstruction)—an invocation of Shekinah to descend the Middle Pillar to Tav:

UOHULU ARPAZNA BINUF LA LA LA ARANA SOBANA FONUSA SAD NEDIEZO LO LAHARA EN NOM TUTULU MAHARNA OBOLO ARARNAY

TUTULU: VII 7:6: "We know why all is hidden in the stone, within the coffin, within the mighty sepulchre, and we too answer Olalám! Imál! Tutúlu! as it is written in the ancient book."

Unconnected imagery at beginning and end of visions: Ambient Yetziratic patterning due to astrological conditions (Eshelman's view).

Comment: The death of the past Aeon, that of Jehovah and Jesus; ends with an adumbration of the new, the vision of the Stelev of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, whose discovery brought about in a human consciousness the knowledge of the Equinox of the Gods.</center>

48, Kokab, sphere of Mercury—or by a Breeze calculation, 31, the secret key of AL. Nuit/Hadit. The TWINS, Ra-Hoor-Khuit/Hoor-Par-Kraat, combined as Heru-Ra-Ha, the Lord of the Aeon. Replacement of the Judgement with the Stele, the Aeon (Judging the Judgers). Crowley on calculations around name—the name means "The Sacred Secret Key-letter of *The Book of the Law* of Thelema, appearing through the Operation of Mercury as well as giving a complete symbolical description of the Stele itself."

Eshelman: DES = 72, the Shem-ham-Mephorash (hence Goetia), and one way of signing the Four Worlds.

The focus here is the *illusory nature* of Tiphareth in relation to Binah. 

It will here be necessary to elaborate just *who the hell* Ankh-f-n-Khonsu is—not just another prior incarnation, we are asked to believe, of the Kelley/Cagliostro/Levi/Crowley entity, but a priest of the war-god Mentu (an analogue of Ra-Hoor-Khuit) during the final dynasty and cultural bloom of Egypt prior to its final conquest by Persia. The mythology is wrapped up with the transmission of the Book of the Law and discovered at the Cairo Museum. Or is AANK just another "spook" that is using Crowley, perhaps as an Egyptian sorceric method of reincarnation? (Crowley's followers recite identifactory, funerary hymns to AANK four times a day.)

Pentagram (destiny of man) in the blackness of heaven that is the blackness of an angel (solar blackness = NOX = opening of mankind to superconsciousness). Angel of destruction symbolizes Jupiter-Jehovah / Osiris-Jesus who are Chesed and Tiphareth and therefore **never extended beyond the abyss to the Supernals**—never even had an idea of them! Absolutely critical. These are tribal gods... they have deprived mankind of hearing and sight (vision and voice, spirit and fire). Hence the V&V.

12^3 = 1728 petals of fire, Zodiac brought to material plane (see Wake World on 13 times tables)=the powers of the name HUA as the Zodiac manifested in 3D form (Nuit?). [Aries/Emperor/Suplhur/Sun] A note suggesting that restriction of love to basic monogamous straight sex is a curse. More notes on formula of YHVH. Cult of Jehovah *cannot even reach Da'ath*. Jehovah is *not even the true Chesed, but the evil Dyad.* (i.e. Qliphoth of Chokmah? Chesed?) Jehovah was the evil Chesed in the Aeon of the True Chesed (Isis), his tyranny broken by the Solar Jesus; symbolized by a golden eagle breakiing out of a golden egg (but only a repeat of Old Aeon).

(Eagle=Jupiter, hence Jehovah, the Demiurge—also symbols of Tiphareth, Air, Sol.)

The Eagle-Headed God Jesus cries: "There is no sin, and there is no salvation." (See the more controversial utterances of the Angels to Dee and Kelley on the non-existence of sin.) Crowley states Jesus knows this truth, but if he says it nobody will care about him. He is an object of worship only for those in the OUTER world of Maya, not for adepts/Chasidim. He senses incoming of NOX. Light is an illusion, truth is an illusion—the great illusions beyond life/space/time. (Elements/Pentagram/Binah/Tree/LVX are all illusions.) Everything is backward... (reversal of consciousness of NOX—see *Liber 333*). Jesus as accursed child of elements, not their father. Calls to Binah and Chokmah to answer *his* prayer but as these spheres are exposing the futility of the intellect of which he is part it matters not. He is being dissolved by the progress of human consciousness. *Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine*: The Church shrinks from blood (Binah/BABALON/formula of 8=3). Anguish of humanity's loss of its ideal. [215 - zarach, "ato shine/rise as sun, to give light, sunrise," "East"]

45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!

46. Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen.

47. But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.

48. My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox, and none by the Book?

Jesus emerges from corruption of four elements and cries out for the supernal NOX. [Jehovah as Air-Kerub]

Commonality of repetition of "woe, woe, woe, woe" etc. in Enochian text. [Perhaps this = Sorrow, Binah, BABALON.] Woe in Enochian is OHIO:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">OHIO</p></h3></center>

The intellect itself, devoid of Supernal inspiration, is dragged forth and cursed. Jehovah as accursed duality. (The accursed Dyad.) Masonic-style curses on the four elements *in the order* that they fall into in the Elemental Tablets. [I.e. slaves shall serve: Worship the world of appearances/Maya and be fucked by it.] Demiurge equated with Ego.

Bright black = Akasha (black/indigo egg—primordial space itself)

Literal pure-night-blue when the Thelemic gods are invoked? 

Blood driven down by gods: Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Stele, and below is Seb/Geb, into whom is concentrated the clotted blood—Earth has absorbed the Carnage of the ruin wrought by Jesus and will grow a new life through putrefectation—the basic formula, not High Magick. The Christian era is fertilizer for the New Aeon. Fun fun for servants of star and snake...

Caput Draconis is head of lion-serpent/Beast 666 (see Enochian Alphabet) [sperm as blood of new Aeon], born of Set/Pan and woman clothed with sun—see Casaubon and Revelation [is the woman clothed with the sun BABALON?] Rev 12:1 "A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head." Atus of Lust + The Aeon give key of New Aeon. (XI+XX=XXXI, Achad's Key.) Stone of Gemini/twins (RHK/HPK). An angel bearing a pitcher/amphora (cup/ATU XVII?) that is Avatar of Babalon. Accompanied by angels of Death (Kalki) and Jehovah/Jesus—these are swallowed up by the lion Beast 666. This lion's mouth is closed by Babalon (Strength). Arrayed with angels with silver spears (Crowley says in later commentary to Liber LXV that angels with spears, weaponry, trumpets, lightning, etc are positive symbols/of HGA rather than the decay and dispersion attendant upon evil genius). Stars burnt up in nostrils (Pranayama). Paraphrase of Bornless One—let all these spirits be as motes dancing in a beam of my eye. 

Swallowing Scorpio and Netzach (wouldn't that be Tiphareth? Yes, Lion is a solar/Tiphareth symbol). Also slain Capricornus and drunk up sea (Cap/Hod). [So lion in Tiphareth crowns the Man's attainment—Crowley's various early notes on all symbols of Adonai being subsumed into that of a Lion, the Beast 666—but it is silenced/ridden by Babalon in Teth.] 419 rays in crown, snake body, [<-- Leo imagery] soul of Crowned Child. 419-418=1; 667[Scarlet Woman]-666=1. 

"In his hand is a spear that is a cup of fornication" = IXº OTO (kept secret here). On mouth is seal of 156. Secret of vvvvv—VVVVV has 10 horns that spring from 5 points (= **The Pentagram, VVVVV**) and 8 heads.

COMMENTARY (ΜΘ)

49 is the square of 7.

7 is the passive and feminine number.

The chapter should be read in connection with Chapter 31 for IT now reappears.

The chapter heading, the Waratah, is a voluptuous scarlet flower, common in Australia, and this connects the chapter with Chapters 28 and 29; but this is only an allusion, for the subject of the chapter is OUR LADY BABALON, who is conceived as the feminine counterpart of IT.

This does not agree very well with the common or orthodox theogony of Chapter 11; but it is to be explained by the dithyrambic nature of the chapter.

In paragraph 3 NO MAN is of course NEMO, the Master of the Temple, Liber 418 will explain most of the allusions in this chapter.

In paragraphs 5 and 6 the author frankly identifies himself with the BEAST referred to in the book, and in the Apocalypse, and in LIBER LEGIS. In paragraph 6 the word “angel” may refer to his mission, and the word “lion-serpent” to the sigil of his ascending decan. (Teth = Snake = spermatozoon and Leo in the Zodiac, which like Teth itself has the snake-form. θ first written ☉ = Lingam-Yoni and Sol.)

Paragraph 7 explains the theological difficulty referred to above. There is only one symbol, but this symbol has many names: of those names BABALON is the holiest. It is the name referred to in Liber Legis, 1, 22.

It will be noticed that the figure, or sigil, of BABALON is a seal upon a ring, and this ring is upon the forefinger of IT. This identifies further the symbol with itself.

It will be noticed that this seal, except for the absence of a border, is the official seal of the A∴A∴ Compare Chapter 3.

It is also said to be the seal upon the tombs of them that she hath slain, that is, of the Masters of the Temple.

In connection with the number 49, see Liber 418, the 22nd Aethyr, as well as the usual authorities.
