Assessing Aleister Crowley (Frater O.M.) and Victor Neuberg's (Frater Omnia Vincam) work with the 30 Aethyrs in 1909, Algeria, from November 23 to December 19 of that year. This working elucidated and developed the Book of the Law (1904) and Thelemic Holy Books (1907), particularly *Liber VII*, and firmly established the Thelemic cosmology that would later inform the O.T.O. and Gnostic Mass. Two years later, the recieved book *Liber Cheth* further developed the iconography of BABALON:
<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">BABALON</p></h3></center>
The Scarlet Woman, who also figures centrally in Revelation, appeared to Dee and Kelley after the wife-swapping incident that ended their partnership, and  appeared to Crowley for the first time in the Algerian sessions. BABALON is not a part of the Golden Dawn Enochian material that Crowley drew on for these sessions, although he may well have read of the Dee and Kelley apparition in the Sloane folios in the British Library(?); Revelation, of course, formed the core of Crowley's psychology as the Bible was his sole reading material during his adolescence in the Plymouth Bretheren, leading him to identify totally with the Beast, the consort of BABALON in Revelation. Crowley thereafter formulated BABALON as the center of his sex-magical or Tantric system, overlaying the Beast/BABALON mythos to the technical sexual magick afforded him only later, in June 1912, upon his admission to the IXº O.T.O. by Theodor Reuss.

Crowley, according to his *Confessions*, had read Casaubon before embarking on his Algerian trip with Neuberg, and had seen Dee and Kelley's scrying implements in the British Museum. Crowley's opinion of Kelley's transmissions is high:

"It is not a jargon; it has a grammar and syntax of its own. It is very much more sonorous, stately and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit, and the English translation, though in places difficult to undersatdn, contains passages of sustained sublimity that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass. To condemn Kelly as a cheating charlatan—the accepted view—is simply stupid. If he invented Enochian, and composed this superb prose, he was at worst a Chatterton with fifty times that poet's ingenuity and five hundred times his poetical genius." – *The Confessions*

##The Aethyrs
<center><img src="http://img44.xooimage.com/files/d/7/0/roue_aethyrs-d1e1f7.jpg"></center>

30 consecutive Aethyrs are outlined by Kelley—as given to Dee and Kelley on July 13, 1584 by the angels Ile and Gabriel (the latter being the same angel that disclosed the Qu'ran to the prophet Mohammed). These aethyrs are either "dominion extending in ever widening circles without and beyond the Watchtowers of the Universe," the cube of the Universe formed by the four tables; or aires simply means "climes" and they pertain to different parts of the world. Either they are spiritual landscapes, terrestrial locations or, somehow, both; Crowley and Neuberg used them as the former and not the latter.

Two mappings of the Aethyrs to the tree are given—one by the Golden Dawn, and another by a second order Golden Dawn schema mentioned in the 9th Aethyr. The first of these, which is elegant enough, is that the Aethyrs map the ten sephiroth as repeated in sequence in the latter 3 of the 4 Qabalistic worlds—Yetzirah, Briah and Atziluth, or the Astral, Causal and Spiritual planes in Theosophical language—skipping Assiah totally, as the Aethyrs are concentric spheres outwith the cube of the physical universe (Malkuth) depicted in the 30th Aethyr. 

This scheme is as follows. We have here included the astrological attributions for each (from the Enochian character attributions) as well as the "Color Scale" for the Aethyrs given in Aethyr 18, ZEN.

##Operating Procedures

Crowley's initial experiments were undertaken by modifying the 19th Call for each Aethyr, and then scrying the Spirit Vision—astral travel or willed imagination—which is outlined in the grade papers of the Golden Dawn. More precise methods, involving prepartory pentagrams and grade signs, are given in his later paper *Liber Chanokh*. None of this is found in Dee and Kelley; they are Golden Dawn methods. 9 years passed between his initial investigation of Aethyrs 30 and 29 and the Algerian experiment; this Crowley attributes to having increased his Grade or spiritual maturity to now be able to handle the visions. This factoring of the observer and their responses to messages, as well as changing information, perhaps, may be applied in reverse to Dee and Kelley. Crowley's line, again from the *Confessions*, is: "Anyone might use the Key for any Aethyr he chose, but he would either get no vision at all or expose himself to deception, and that probably of the deadly dangerous kind."

![Bou Saada](http://famouswonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Bou-Saada.jpg "Bou Saada")
<center><sub>The desert near Bou Saada</sub></center>

In Bou Saada, Algeria, Crowley employed a "great golden topaz (set in a Calvary cross of six squares, made of wood, painted vermillion) engraved with a Greek cross of five squares charged with the Rose of forty-nine petals." 49 is the number of squares in each Table. (This topaz, I am recalling off the top of my head, was stolen from Sascha Germer by the Solar Lodge in the late 1960s and subsequently lost in a fire at their ranch.) Crowley would scry into this stone physically after reciting the call. This is a marked difference from his earlier "spirit vision" methods; astral travel is essentially willed imagination with eyes closed, while scrying is looking for visuals in a physical object with eyes open. His method at this point was the simply let the Aethyr itself "overshadow" his senses as he drifted into deep trance—bringing the Aethyr to him instead of going to it. In doing this (according to Eshelman) Crowley worked to maintain an observer's perspective (in Yetzirah) instead of going fully into Samadhi upon the contents of the Aethyr. He describes this approach in the 20th Aethyr.

Recieved information was later checked by Qabalistic correspondence, Crowley's favored check against self-delusion. For Crowley, if a "spirit" code transmit accurate Qabalistic codes, and in particular if it demonstrated that it knew more Qabalah than him, then his connection to the other side was valid. When dealing with the Otherworlds, this was the equivalent of a Masonic handshake or, as we might say today, a valid password or SSH key. Later magical students, more influenced by pop psychology, like Crowley's once-secretary Israel Regardie, would have explained this by suggesting that Crowley—and, indeed, Kelley—were simply accessing deeper parts of their own brains, portions more advanced than their waking consciousness. [What does modern psychology/neuroscience say about this?]

Dee and Kelley utilized no such tests.

For Crowley, the Enochian visions subsumed *all* prior world religions, mystery cults and esoteric symbolism, all of it ultimately giving way to the incoming Aeon of Horus that had been announced by Aleister and Rose Crowley's 1904 reception of the *Book of the Law* in Cairo. *The Vision of the Voice* far surpasses this book both in length and complexity, and fully elucidates and develops the doctrine of the Aeon, which would inform Crowley's later attempts to formulate Thelema as an organized and terrestrial religion as opposed to something he had seen only while in a visionary state. That the content of Crowley's Enochian visions seem to confirm his own developing philosophy and primacy as a messianic figure immediately makes them suspect, even by Crowley's own standards—writing later, in the "Notes for an Astral Atlas" appendix to *Book 4*, Crowley warns the student that:

"Remember, then, always, but especially when dealing with the Astral Plane, that man's breath stirs the Feather of Truth. What one sees and hears is 'real' in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or created by one's personality... 

"The Magician may go on for a long time being fooled and flattered by the Astrals that he has himself modified or manufactured. Their natural subservience to himself will please him, poor ape!

"They will pretend to show him marvellous mysteries, pageants of beauty and wonder unspeakably splendid; he will incline to accept them as true, for the very reason that they are images of himself idealized by the imagination.

"But his real progress will stop dead. These phantasms will prevent him from coming into contact with independent intelligences, from whom alone he can learn anything new.

"He will become increasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to be attaining one initiation after another. His Ego will expand unchecked, till he seem to himself to have heaven at his feet. Yet all this will be nothing but his fool's face of Narcissus smirking up from the pool that will drown him." [(via)](http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/app3.html)

In many ways, *The Vision and the Voice* marks the high point of Crowley's career as an Adept—now a Magister Templi—of the Golden Dawn system outlined by his mentor Mathers. Post-Algeria, Crowley would be wrapped up in the drama of a new mystery school—the Ordo Templi Orientis or OTO—and concern himself largely with its sexual methods and with instituting Thelema as a religion, with himself as the head. His research progressed along other lines, and administrative manners; however, Crowley the Pure Seeker was never quite so pristine, to be replaced with Crowley the PR Man for the Aeon.

Additionally, Crowley used a Muslim mantra, from Surah 112, while travelling across the desert—this being done to enter receptive mental states, or "purify" himself as he put it, by creating states of absolute physical exhaustion so that his body would not disturb his mind, much like the use of *asana* in Hatha Yoga:

*Qul: Huw-Allahu ahad; Allahu samad; lam yalid wa lam yulad; wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad.* 

This was recited 1,001 times per day, with each recitation followed by a prostration. (1,001 is obviously taken from *1,001 Nights*, translated by Crowley's early hero and role model Richard Burton; it is used in this book to denote an infinitely large number, much as the number 10,000 is used in Buddhist texts. The number is indeed important in Sufism; students of the [Mevlevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevlevi_Order) dervish order must undergo 1,001 days of prayer before becoming a teacher.)

Crowley was now able to penetrate beyond the initial two aethyrs; his progress beyond the 19th was assisted by a specially appointed Angelic guardian; the following aethyrs concerned the equilibriation and then destruction of Crowley's individual self. By the 14th Aethyr, Crowley and Neuberg has climbed the mountain Daleh Addin—this mountain is now called Djebel Chélia or simply Chélia; it was here that Crowley began to have Victor Neuberg sodomize him, as an effort in taboo-breaking and disruption of the personality—Crowley writes (circuitiously, as sodomy was still illegal, a major reason for Crowley's often obfuscatory writing and personal legal troubles) that "I may say that the essence of the matter was that I had hitherto clung to certain conceptions of conduct which, while perfectly proper from the standpoint of my human nature, were impertinent to initiation." This may have assisted visionary states; it may also have been a deep working out of Crowley's own conflict around his sexuality. While homosexuality was not new for him, passive sodomy may have been. This sexual taboo-breaking also occurs in Madimi's request that Dee and Kelley swap wives, perhaps as a way of deeply disrupting the personality in order to open it to further visionary input. As Dee and Kelley eventually did, Crowley writes that he "obeyed my Angel," and turned passive sodomy [was it actually this?] into a means of invoking his Holy Guardian Angel. He would later write in the comfort of his own intellect and literary anonymity in the *Bagh-i-Muattar*, where he becomes much more confident and bombastic. Crowley glyphed this act in later writings as "XIº OTO"—homosexual sex magick—although at the time he had not yet been initiated to OTO.

![Djebel Chelia](http://www.vitaminedz.com/photos/27/27067-djebel-chelia-aures.jpg "Djebel Chélia")
<center><sub>Djebel Chélia as it appears today.</sub></center>

These acts, he wrote, disrupted his personality and undermined his ego totally—he was in a state of psychosis or mania, perhaps. Crowley was now to enter the "City of Pyramids," a landscape informed by the Enochian tablets or rather the Golden Dawn conceit of turning their squares into pyramids, this being the habitation of Masters or non-physical adepts, and given to the task of the Master of the Temple in raising up humanity, in Crowley's case under the planetary aegis of Jupiter or the sphere Chesed. The Queen of the City of Pyramids was now revealed to be BABALON herself, who accepted the blood of the saints here encamped, and to whom they were enjoined to offer their ego totally, under penalty of imperfect initiation and stagnation; similary to Dee and Kelley's account of the "Daughter of Fortitude," BABALON's appearance followed the successful accomplishment of the breaking of sexual taboo.

Now being "abandoned" by his angelic guardian, Crowley was told to call the 10th Aethyr, ZAX, and cross the "Abyss" or separation between God and man, noumenon and phenomenon, the guardian of which was CHORONZON, the "mighty devil" [c] described by Kelley. Crowley was here taking the name "Coronzon" from Casaubon and changing the spelling to Choronzon, potentially so that were the name transliterated into Hebrew, the first letter would be Cheth, "Ch." Crowley's Hebrew transliteration, given in *Sepher Sephiroth*, is ChVRVNZVN, Cheth-Vau-Resh-Vau-Nun-Zayin-Vau-Nun, enumerating to 333 by Gematria. By Greek gematria, 333 also enumerates to the words for "incontinence, dispersion, debauchery and wantonness"—in Hebrewm it also enumerates to AYQ BKR, the Qabalah of the nine chambers, and ShLG, snow (Eshelman adds HChShN, the darknessm and HShChVTCh, the slaughtered). All of this suggests the dispersion of the mind or, as Eshelman puts it, the "Anti-Will."

However, this spelling is one of several things that Casaubon got wrong; Dee's diaries themselves identify this entity as "Coronzom," and this has been corrected in Stephen Skinner's revision of Casaubon. In Enochian letters, this would be:

<center><h2><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">CORONZOM</p></h2></center>

[**NOTE:** This Enochian web font, designed in 1996, is inaccurate. It uses the same character (Don) for Don (R) and Tal (M), a common beginner mistake; they are different characters. See the Enochian alphabet below. This means the final Tal or M is not correct, this would unfortunately have to be done by hand. Then again, maybe it's best not to put a demon's name online.]

<center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Enochian_alphabet.png/550px-Enochian_alphabet.png"></center>

From Dee's diaries (quoted from Eshelman, not Skinner):

*But Coronzon[sic] (for so is the name of that mighty devil), envying man's felicity, and perceiving that the substance of man's lesser part was frail and unperfect in respect to his purer essence, began to assail man, and so prevailed.*

This demon—representing the final chaos of the mind or the reason/discursive ego itself incorrectly attempting to usurp the throne of God or pure, trans-linguistic, transpersonal spiritual intuition ("knowledge is a false crown [i.e. is not Kether though may appear to be to one who has not overcome their ego]")—was evoked into a triangle using the medium of pigeon blood (three pigeons were sacrificed), in operating procedures taken from the *Göetia* or *Lesser Key of Solomon*—Kelley had been rebuked by the Angels for his prior work with Göetia. Neuberg worked as the operator while Crowley himself stood in the triangle, perhaps hoping Neuberg would "exorcise" the Choronzom complex from him totally. Crowley was possessed, broke the circle and attacked Neuberg; Neuberg banished the demon back to the triangle by vibrating the Qabalistic names of God and striking Crowley with his magical dagger. The demon returned to the triangle where it continued to psychologically attack Neuberg until the "energy" in the spilled pigeon blood was depleted. Crowley wrote the name of BABALON in the sand with his ring, and emerged from his possession trance. The ordeal lasted two hours.

Beyond ZAX, the character of the Aethyrs changed. Crowley notes that the original text of the 19th Call reads, at face value, as curse:

"O YE Heavens which dwell in the first Air, yea are mighty in the parts of the Earth, and execute the Judgment of the Highest! Unto you it is said: Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth, and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding to dispose all things according to the Providence of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, and rose up in the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be governed by her parts, and let there be Division in her, that the glory of her may be always drunken, and vexed in itself. Her course, let it run with the Heavens; and as an handmaid let her serve them. One season, let it confound another, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her members, let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one Creature equal with another. The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them forget their Names. The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His buildings, let them become Caves for the beasts of the Field! Confound her understanding with darkness! For why? it repenteth me that I have made Man. One while let her be known, and another while a stranger: because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that is fallen."

In the 9th Aethyr and beyond, and Coronzom overcome, the text appeared to Crowley as a blessing, showing that is only the mind of man which projects evil and disorder upon the pristine perfection of the Universe and, that mind being overcome, there was now nothing but perfection to see. [Elizabethan conception of chaos.] Without an ego, there was now nothing to suffer, and nothing to make suffer. It was years, however, before Crowley could fully assimilate this perspective. As anybody who has tasted heaven through spirtual practice or drugs can tell you, there's always a comedown, and always a morning after. But once you've seen freedom, you can't forget that it exists, and you can begin the work of slowly retraining a lifetime of bad thinking and false perception—*samskaras*, as Hindu meditators would say—to fall in line with the new perspective.

The remaining Aethyrs showed progressive visions of purity and grace, until the sequence ended. (My own experiences with the 30 Aethyrs, repeated in haphazard fashion in 2006 with a group of 7 individuals, can be found in *Ultraculture Journal.*)

##Astrological Factors

Though not calculated or timed by Crowley and Neuberg, James Eshelman later worked to analyze the astrology of each Aethyr calling itself as an attempt to isolate astrological influences on the visions from the actual content of the Aethyrs themselves. This is outside our scope for the present work but will be mentioned when appropriate here. Eshelman notes that the sun was in sidereal Scorpio (tropical Sagittarius) between the 28th and 5th Aethyrs, highly relevant to the sexual/destructive qualities of BABALON. 

##Summary of Method

Here, then, is a summary of the methods used by O.M. and Omnia Vincam:

1. Sensory deprivation and social isolation by remaining in uninhabited desert conditions.
2. Physical exhaustion from crossing desert while making 1,001 prostrations per day.
3. Mental focus and emptiness by making 1,001 recitations of Surah 112 per day.
4. The recitation of the 19th Call, modified for each Aethyr.
5. Physically scrying into a golden topaz, while overshadowed by the Aethyr.
6. Taboo-breaking by homosexual sex magick (passive sodomy).
7. Göetic-style evocation AND invocation with aid of animal sacrifice for material basis.

Methods 1-3 would have formed a powerful separation from anything but the ritual psychotheater generated by methods 4-7; such devices are well known by cults the world over as ways of isolating individuals and removing them from anything but the world view of the cult. While here the cult consisted of only two individuals and the methods self-applied, the techniques are consistent. Within such conditions, and within a shared private universe, Crowley and Neuberg—like Dee and Kelley before them—were able to enter a kind of "virtual reality" generated by their unfettered minds, emerging with one of the most striking literary and religious works, in my opinion, of the 20th century. The prose of *The Vision and the Voice* is the best of Crowley's career, surpassing even the Holy Books; like Kelley's messages from the Angels, it is at once exquisitely sacred and profoundly chilling. Next to Dee and Kelley's own Spirit Diaries, it is the primary document of Enochian magick in practice—while Dee and Kelley received the system, Crowley and Neuberg actually *used* it—or at least used a section of it, namely the 30 Aethyrs, rather than the Holy Table itself (Crowley would use the Tablets in later workings, particularly in combination with the VIIIº OTO or masturbatory sex magick). For this reason, *The Vision and the Voice*, or *Liber 418* as it is technically designated in Crowley's A∴A∴, should be studied alongside Dee and Kelley's work.

Following are analyses of each Aethyr. 

##Sources and Publication History

I will here be referring to the following texts:

Crowley, Aleister, with Victor B. Neuberg and Mary Desti. *The Vision & The Voice, With Commentary and Other Papers. (The Equinox, Vol. IV, No. II).* York Beach: Weiser, 1998.

Eshelman, James A. *Visions & Voices: Aleister Crowley's Enochian Visions With Astrological & Qabalistic Commentary.* Los Angeles: The College of Thelema, 2011.

*The Vision & The Voice* was originally published, uncommented, as the special supplement to *The Equinox*, Vol. I, No. V, 1911. Two sets of commentary were later added by Crowley, which were published in a 1952 edition of *V&V* by Karl Germer, which was again revised by Israel Regardie in 1972, who mixed his own notes in with Crowley's without distinction. The final version was William Breeze's, used here and noted above. The very original text was handwritten by Victor Neuberg in Algeria.

[Breeze edition: Malkuth, Yesod, Hod and Netzach in Malkuth. Also Hod and Netzach on the Tree. I am quite confused by these attributions in Equinox 4.2.]

Suggests incoming of Aeon of Horus; 18º Rose-Croix degree of Scottish Rite. Also the imagery is consistent with the path of Tav (Saturn) leading from Malkuth.

Crystal cube in form of Harpocrates (Malkuth) surrounded by sphere (Aethyrs)—"I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. 'Come unto me' is a foolish word: for it is I that go'"—surrounded by four archangels. Suggests Pentagram ritual. Harpocrates is the center of the 4 archangels—"(This is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein am I as a babe in an egg.)"

New Aeon comes in at Four Quarters, in each of which an Archangel holds a book labelled back and front in Enochian. [Note: The M's are fucked in the font.] The Archangels are in black robes, their wings and armor lined out in white. All this symbolism seems to elaborate the Pentagram Ritual. Tetragrammaton imagery is found throughout.

Crowley, from *Book 4*:

*The formation of the "Yod" is the formulation of the first creative force, of that father who is called "self-begotten", and unto whom it is said: "Thou has formulated thy Father, and made fertile thy Mother". The adding of the "He" to the "Yod" is the marriage of that Father to the great co-equal Mother, who is a reflection of Nuit as He is of Hadit. Their union brings forth the son "Vau" who is the heir. Finally the daughter "He" is produced. She is both the twin sister and the daughter of "Vau". His mission is to redeem her by making her his bride; the result of this is to set her upon the throne of her mother, and it is only she whose youthful embrace can reawaken the eld of the All-Father. In this complex family relationship is symbolised the whole course of the Universe. It will be seen that (after all) the Climax is at the end. It is the second half of the formula which symbolises the Great Work which we are pledged to accomplish. The first step of this is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, which constitutes the Adept of the Inner Order. The re-entry of these twin spouses into the womb of the mother is that initiation described in Liber 418, which gives admission to the Inmost Order of the A∴ A∴ Of the last step we cannot speak.*

*Then arose the Great DRAGON with Seven Heads and Ten Horns, and the Garden was made desolate, and MALKUTH was cut off from the Sephiroth by his intersecting folds, and linked unto the Kingdom of Shells. And the Seven Lower Sephiroth were cut off
from the Three Supernals in DAATH, at the feet of AIMA ELOHIM.*

*And on the Heads of the Dragon are the Names and Crowns of the Edomite Kings. And because in DAATH was the greatest rise of the Great Serpent of Evil, therefore is there, as it were, another Sephirah, making for the Infernal or Averse Sephiroth, Eleven instead of Ten.*

*And hence were the Rivers of Eden desecrated, and from the Mouth of the DRAGON rushed the Infernal Waters in DAATH. And this is LEVIATHAN, The Crooked Serpent.*

*But between the Devastated Garden and the Supernal Eden, YOD HE VAU HE ELOHIM placed the Letters of THE NAME and THE
FLASHING SWORD that the uppermost part of the Tree of Life might not be involved in the Fall of Adam. And thence it was
necessary that the SECOND ADAM should come to restore all things and that,as the First Adam had been extended on the Cross of
the Celestial Rivers, so the SON should be crucified on the Cross of the Infernal Rivers of DAATH. Yet, to do this, he must descend unto the lowest first, even unto Malkuth and be born of her.*

Comment: The disturbance of Equilibrium caused by the Coming of the Aeon.</center>

Green sky covered with gold stars, dark (Venus/Solar). The imagery is the four beasts of Daniel and Apocalypse, surrounding the throne of the Elders (seen in Aethyr 30), as in ATU XXI and ATU X Rider-Waite. Also the Kerubs of the Elements, following on from the Pentagram Ritual symbolism in Aethyr 30 (Kerubs are seen in Supreme Pentagram Ritual of GD).

Scorpio-Taurus: East-West. Leo-Aquarius: South-North. As if Antares, Regulus and Aldebaran were rising, culminating and setting. Scorpio-Taurus=Nun Vav, NU; + Leo=Teth, NUT, Nuit.

**East:** Eagle-angel/Scorpio/Water/Heh/Understanding, wings hide heaven (the immediate, scary future). Speech reminiscent of ATU XX in Rider-Waite. This is the GD attribution but years later Crowley would re-attribute the Eagle to Air instead of Water, leaving Scorpio.

Chesed absorbed in the Abyss.

**South:** Lion/Leo/Fire/Yod/Wisdom, wounded and perplexed, the Beast 666, Sol in Strength. Wounded masculine of Aeon of Osiris—dying patriarchy?

**West:** Bull/Taurus/Earth/Heh final, white with horns of white and black and gold, scarlet mouth, sapphire eyes, cleaving sky with sword (air, as Taurus itself is attributed to air), lightning and deep clouds of Indigo. Again the YHVH symbolism. The fall of Christianity/Osiris/Mithras. Work of Yesod/2=9 A.A.

**North:** Man/Libra [instead of Aquarius]/Saturn on Great horse with scourge and balances (Libra/Lamed/Justice), black velvet - similar to Death of Apocalypse (Kalki) (Note: Death/Kalki, as is Horus, is "crowned and conquering" in Revelation). Gaze into unconscious to see superconsciousness.

Air as herald of Aquarius/Current of destiny in the body of Nuit. Everything is changed, and it only looks like chaos (CHAOS = Chokmah and a name of the Beast, see Biroco Kaos 14) but it is the skeleton of a new truth. Light consumed in womb of Binah to create itself anew. LVX/INRI:IAO/TARO passwords (see The Wake World)—LVX cross hidden in cubical Swastika. 65, 231, 21, 78. 18º SR?

Glory to the most high god. In Enochian, this is:

An invocation of Binah, of the wheel of Time, and foreshadowing of the Abyss/ZAX.

An angel (Hod/Aries) in a sapphire stone suggesting Tiphareth and Path Samekh, with eyes suggesting Binah (the Angel and the Abyss), warding Binah. The end of the illusion of Time. If you come here you must be scarred with sorrow (become 8=3). Unification of opposing sephira—Sun/Moon, Mars/Venus, Saturn/Jupiter. [The entire V&V is Crowley's initiation to Binah.]

The four Watch-Towers of the Elements are *within* Chesed/Jupiter as symbolized by Sapphire (four/Jupiter/stability of universe). Crossed arms of Osiris at Tiphareth before destruction as salt (8=3). 8=3 may make a new Qabalah, but intellectual manipulations are useless for crossing Abyss. 

Enochian writing:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">OLAHO VIRUDEN MAHORELA ZODIREDA! ON PIREDA EXENTASER; ARBA PIRE GAH GAHA GAHAL GAHALANA VO ABRA NA GAHA VELUCORSAPAX.</p></h3></center>

Which is suggested to be part lunar language. Laycock's translation for Regardie:

"For the second time I have beautified those dark Heavens I inhabit! builded there for the Holy Mother of all. The shrine of the spirits existed, exists, and shall exist, wherein it is provided that the Babe of the Abyss [is] enthroned."

Name of warden, by a cipher, is:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">LIXIPSL</p></h3></center>

Originally calculated as Draco Magnus or Mighty Dragon, Nuit/Binah. Breeze notes this should be 552, "Desiderium dierum," 
"Longing for the days." Eshelman gives 491 by Hebrew and 620 by Enochian; he suggests the angel was trolling him by making him dwell on exactly the kind of intellectual bs he had just warned against. Angel says that it is above the three angels of this Aethyr, but that there are four angels in the 30th Aethyr who have none above them (therefore breaking up into the dispersion of Coronzom).

"Face of mother is scarred by nails of devil" = Vau Vau Vau, 666? The number of mankind and also Sol, Tiphareth, below Binah. The seer descends to physically viewing his Rose Cross (rose cross imagery = his scrying equipment).

Core message of Aethyr BAG, which corresponds directly to 3=8 Practicus grade, is that truth comes from intuition, not intellect. The transcendence of the intellect (HOD) which is the primary task of the Practicus.

Passwords of all grades (55 + 45 + 36 + 28 + 21 + 15 + 10) = 210 = NOX, the Word of the Abyss.

522 = Vau-Vau-Mem = 21, mystery of ATU XVIII, exaltation of Venus in Pisces (seems doubtful).

Eshelman: Leo Taurus Taurus = 7+1+1 = 9, Yesod (Moon).

If the paths truly are attributed by Sephira/4 Worlds as Eshelman suggests, there seems to be a lot of reflecting of higher worlds into lower (similar to how grades mirror the lessons of their reversals, i.e. 3=8/8=3). 

Lunar and Venusian imagery (silver, huntress, etc—hence Hecate). Path Gimel (Hecate, Luna). Luna as the Sensorium, man's spiritual state in relation to perceived phenomena. This seems to track lunar/huntress imagery *across* the tree—Venus/Luna/Gimel/Sagittarius. Specifically: Gimel, Yesod, Qoph. This triple attribution of the moon = [Threefold Goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)) (Mother/Maiden/Crone, Hecate, the outer manifestation of BABALON/Binah, etc. Binah=3.) Imagery here subsumes all lunar. 

War of Aires and elements (I seem to remember that somebody somewhere actually took this to mean there was a war between angels of the Aethyrs and the ones of the Tablets; Crowley here suggests it to mean that coefficients of Circle and Square must be commensurable—squaring of circle, etc?) Eshelman: Tablets as interface between cubical material universe and Aethyrs. (Their letters form governors of Aethyrs; suggesting perhaps tablets as faces of cube projecting the Aethyrs OUTWARD like a holographic projection? War as Ruach vs Neshamah.)

Rainbow path of Qesheth, Rainbow of Promise, Archer's Bow of Sagittarius = Solar light of Tiphareth *reflecting on* the lunar waters of Yesod (therefore creating the Path blending of the two Sephira); those who walk the path successfully become *Hodos Chamelionis* in G.D.

Kamailos = camel/rope across abyss. Angel of Daleth/love of Supernals balancing Path Gimel (similar to Samekh balancing Peh). Calling to hounds in the Lunar Language.

This symbols appears in Adeptus Minor initiation of GD in center of floor of Vault of the Adepti and also on the head of the Pastos. It is a symbol of Venus and now BABALON—and, of course, there are 49 Calls in total, 49 days in the Bardo between death and reincarnation in Tibetan Buddhism, 49 Tables given to Dee and Kelley by the angels (see DeSalvo, *Decoding the Enochian Secrets*, making this a most crucial number. 49 is also HGYAL, the Intelligence of Venus, MT, the Rod of Aaron, and many more. And of course is 7 x 7 (see the Seal of Babalon).

Art card/Sagittarius (Cauldron). Hecate does not understand why BABALON needs the blood of the Adepts. Pearls = Masters of Temple secreted by Binah around specks of dust. Dragon as mask of Kephra in ATU XVIII. Black Dragon stage of alchemy (Portal ritual). Stone as code word for intimate union. Da'ath=Knowledge=Gnosis? (!) 

Echoes of Liber LXV and VII. Phenomenon of destruction of phenomenon for M.T.; kisses... The word of the Aeon is MAKHASHANAH (418, a blind for ABRAHADABRA). And to call Hecate (Yorke reconstruction)—an invocation of Shekinah to descend the Middle Pillar to Tav:

UOHULU ARPAZNA BINUF LA LA LA ARANA SOBANA FONUSA SAD NEDIEZO LO LAHARA EN NOM TUTULU MAHARNA OBOLO ARARNAY

TUTULU: VII 7:6: "We know why all is hidden in the stone, within the coffin, within the mighty sepulchre, and we too answer Olalám! Imál! Tutúlu! as it is written in the ancient book."

Unconnected imagery at beginning and end of visions: Ambient Yetziratic patterning due to astrological conditions (Eshelman's view).

48, Kokab, sphere of Mercury—or by a Breeze calculation, 31, the secret key of AL. Nuit/Hadit. The TWINS, Ra-Hoor-Khuit/Hoor-Par-Kraat, combined as Heru-Ra-Ha, the Lord of the Aeon. Replacement of the Judgement with the Stele, the Aeon (Judging the Judgers). Crowley on calculations around name—the name means "The Sacred Secret Key-letter of *The Book of the Law* of Thelema, appearing through the Operation of Mercury as well as giving a complete symbolical description of the Stele itself."

Eshelman: DES = 72, the Shem-ham-Mephorash (hence Goetia), and one way of signing the Four Worlds.

The focus here is the *illusory nature* of Tiphareth in relation to Binah. 

It will here be necessary to elaborate just *who the hell* Ankh-f-n-Khonsu is—not just another prior incarnation, we are asked to believe, of the Kelley/Cagliostro/Levi/Crowley entity, but a priest of the war-god Mentu (an analogue of Ra-Hoor-Khuit) during the final dynasty and cultural bloom of Egypt prior to its final conquest by Persia. The mythology is wrapped up with the transmission of the Book of the Law and discovered at the Cairo Museum. Or is AANK just another "spook" that is using Crowley, perhaps as an Egyptian sorceric method of reincarnation? (Crowley's followers recite identifactory, funerary hymns to AANK four times a day.)

Pentagram (destiny of man) in the blackness of heaven that is the blackness of an angel (solar blackness = NOX = opening of mankind to superconsciousness). Angel of destruction symbolizes Jupiter-Jehovah / Osiris-Jesus who are Chesed and Tiphareth and therefore **never extended beyond the abyss to the Supernals**—never even had an idea of them! Absolutely critical. These are tribal gods... they have deprived mankind of hearing and sight (vision and voice, spirit and fire). Hence the V&V.

12^3 = 1728 petals of fire, Zodiac brought to material plane (see Wake World on 13 times tables)=the powers of the name HUA as the Zodiac manifested in 3D form (Nuit?). [Aries/Emperor/Suplhur/Sun] A note suggesting that restriction of love to basic monogamous straight sex is a curse. More notes on formula of YHVH. Cult of Jehovah *cannot even reach Da'ath*. Jehovah is *not even the true Chesed, but the evil Dyad.* (i.e. Qliphoth of Chokmah? Chesed?) Jehovah was the evil Chesed in the Aeon of the True Chesed (Isis), his tyranny broken by the Solar Jesus; symbolized by a golden eagle breakiing out of a golden egg (but only a repeat of Old Aeon).

(Eagle=Jupiter, hence Jehovah, the Demiurge—also symbols of Tiphareth, Air, Sol.)

The Eagle-Headed God Jesus cries: "There is no sin, and there is no salvation." (See the more controversial utterances of the Angels to Dee and Kelley on the non-existence of sin.) Crowley states Jesus knows this truth, but if he says it nobody will care about him. He is an object of worship only for those in the OUTER world of Maya, not for adepts/Chasidim. He senses incoming of NOX. Light is an illusion, truth is an illusion—the great illusions beyond life/space/time. (Elements/Pentagram/Binah/Tree/LVX are all illusions.) Everything is backward... (reversal of consciousness of NOX—see *Liber 333*). Jesus as accursed child of elements, not their father. Calls to Binah and Chokmah to answer *his* prayer but as these spheres are exposing the futility of the intellect of which he is part it matters not. He is being dissolved by the progress of human consciousness. *Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine*: The Church shrinks from blood (Binah/BABALON/formula of 8=3). Anguish of humanity's loss of its ideal. [215 - zarach, "ato shine/rise as sun, to give light, sunrise," "East"]

45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!

46. Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen.

47. But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.

48. My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox, and none by the Book?

Jesus emerges from corruption of four elements and cries out for the supernal NOX. [Jehovah as Air-Kerub]

Commonality of repetition of "woe, woe, woe, woe" etc. in Enochian text. [Perhaps this = Sorrow, Binah, BABALON.] Woe in Enochian is OHIO:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">OHIO</p></h3></center>

The intellect itself, devoid of Supernal inspiration, is dragged forth and cursed. Jehovah as accursed duality. (The accursed Dyad.) Masonic-style curses on the four elements *in the order* that they fall into in the Elemental Tablets. [I.e. slaves shall serve: Worship the world of appearances/Maya and be fucked by it.] Demiurge equated with Ego.

Bright black = Akasha (black/indigo egg—primordial space itself)

Literal pure-night-blue when the Thelemic gods are invoked? 

Blood driven down by gods: Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Stele, and below is Seb/Geb, into whom is concentrated the clotted blood—Earth has absorbed the Carnage of the ruin wrought by Jesus and will grow a new life through putrefectation—the basic formula, not High Magick. The Christian era is fertilizer for the New Aeon. Fun fun for servants of star and snake...

Eshelman: Enochian enumerates to 25, 5x5 (Geburah), YHVD (Briatic Name of Geburah), ChIVA (Beast- Shiva as Pashupatinath?). Not mentioned by JAE is that 25=the Pentagram, and of course V.V.V.V.V., the head of A.A. and Crowley's motto as Magister Templi, who is here identified with the Beast and has "10 horns that spring from 5 points" and 8 heads.

Crowley identifies the Beast with both Leo AND Caput Draconis and occasionally confuses them in his handwritten notes.

Caput Draconis is head of lion-serpent/Beast 666 (see Enochian Alphabet) [sperm as blood of new Aeon], born of Set/Pan and woman clothed with sun—see Casaubon and Revelation [is the woman clothed with the sun BABALON?] Rev 12:1 "A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head." Atus of Lust + The Aeon give key of New Aeon. (XI+XX=XXXI, Achad's Key.) Stone of Gemini/twins (RHK/HPK). An angel bearing a pitcher/amphora (cup/ATU XVII?) that is Avatar of Babalon. Angel consolidatess paths going downward to Tiphereth from Supernals—Gimel (intersecting Teth—Moon/Sun, high tantric, AL:I he sun/she moon etc), Zayin and Heh.

Accompanied by angels of Death (Samekh) (Kalki) and Jehovah/Jesus (A'ayin)—these are swallowed up by the lion Beast 666. This lion's mouth is closed by Babalon (Strength). Arrayed with angels with silver spears (Crowley says in later commentary to Liber LXV that angels with spears, weaponry, trumpets, lightning, etc are positive symbols/of HGA rather than the decay and dispersion attendant upon evil genius). Stars burnt up in nostrils (Pranayama). Paraphrase of Bornless One—let all these spirits be as motes dancing in a beam of my eye. 

Teth actually means "a coiling, twisting" according to Karl Feyerabend (not Paul)=i.e. Kundalini, which also literally means "coiled" (not snake) in Sanskrit—by *Sepher Yetzirah*, Teth, is "the consciousness of the secret of all spiritual activities." Devouring of everything by *shushumna* channel (hence kundalini imagery and Babalon as Sakti). Blasting trumpets = nadi sounds, see Hatha Yoga Pradpika, as well as ATU XX in old deck (Israfel).

The word Gimel (GML) is a formula for advance of the Adeptus Minor—the goal in reflection in lower grades? (Similar to cleaving to Samekh while in Hod/Netzach?) GML, Gimel spelt in full = Paths Gimel, Mem, Lamed (see tree). Hod>Geburah>Tiphareth>Kether.

Swallowing Scorpio and Netzach (wouldn't that be Tiphareth? Yes, Lion is a solar/Tiphareth symbol). Also slain Capricornus and drunk up sea (Cap/Hod). [So lion in Tiphareth crowns the Man's attainment—Crowley's various early notes on all symbols of Adonai being subsumed into that of a Lion, the Beast 666—but it is silenced/ridden by Babalon in Teth.] 419 rays in crown, snake body, [<-- Leo imagery] soul of Crowned Child. 419-418=1; 667[Scarlet Woman]-666=1. 

419=TITh, Teth in full; 418 = ChITh, Beast +1=419

"In his hand is a spear that is a cup of fornication" = IXº OTO (kept secret here). On mouth is seal of 156. Secret of vvvvv—VVVVV has 10 horns that spring from 5 points (= **The Pentagram, VVVVV**) and 8 [Cheth, same spelling as ChITh, beast.] heads.

COMMENTARY (ΜΘ)

49 is the square of 7.

7 is the passive and feminine number.

The chapter should be read in connection with Chapter 31 for IT now reappears.

The chapter heading, the Waratah, is a voluptuous scarlet flower, common in Australia, and this connects the chapter with Chapters 28 and 29; but this is only an allusion, for the subject of the chapter is OUR LADY BABALON, who is conceived as the feminine counterpart of IT.

This does not agree very well with the common or orthodox theogony of Chapter 11; but it is to be explained by the dithyrambic nature of the chapter.

In paragraph 3 NO MAN is of course NEMO, the Master of the Temple, Liber 418 will explain most of the allusions in this chapter.

In paragraphs 5 and 6 the author frankly identifies himself with the BEAST referred to in the book, and in the Apocalypse, and in LIBER LEGIS. In paragraph 6 the word “angel” may refer to his mission, and the word “lion-serpent” to the sigil of his ascending decan. (Teth = Snake = spermatozoon and Leo in the Zodiac, which like Teth itself has the snake-form. θ first written ☉ = Lingam-Yoni and Sol.)

Paragraph 7 explains the theological difficulty referred to above. There is only one symbol, but this symbol has many names: of those names BABALON is the holiest. It is the name referred to in Liber Legis, 1, 22.

It will be noticed that the figure, or sigil, of BABALON is a seal upon a ring, and this ring is upon the forefinger of IT. This identifies further the symbol with itself.

It will be noticed that this seal, except for the absence of a border, is the official seal of the A∴A∴ Compare Chapter 3.

It is also said to be the seal upon the tombs of them that she hath slain, that is, of the Masters of the Temple.

In connection with the number 49, see Liber 418, the 22nd Aethyr, as well as the usual authorities.

Beast is charioteer (Cheth) of West, bearer of Sangraal. Heru-Ra-Ha as martial aspect of Sol (5=6/6=5), warrior lord of sun: "There is a splendour in my name hidden and glorious, as the sun of midnight is ever the son." Yet in him is woman that devoureth with her water all the fire of God [IXº OTO].

"Hell" as inmost part of man that consumes all experiences and thereby understands its own perfection (Formula of Babalon, queen of hell). 32 teeth, tongue as firey logos, four rivers of Eden that flow from Da'ath, see Aethyr 30 = fourfold understanding of logos (in four worlds). Blasphemed by TAOTZEM (taking material for spiritual sun—note for Resh). Name not to know in case pronounce and pass by (alphabet of passing the river?) Crowley weighed with sin of world. Foreshadow 9=2 initiation. 

Creature of earth and ye would have me swim = Assiah transfer to Yetzirah. Lion passes over Aethyr with crowned beast (VVVVV) on his back. In his tail are cities, planets etc. Tuft is a new universe. A foreshadowing of the Aeon of Thmaist, the Double-Wanded One (Greek form of Ma'at)—Lamed, proceeding away from Tiphareth to Geburah. A pale stern figure bigger than the universe, in silver (Luna) armour with a sword and pair of balances (Mars/Lamed, in Pillar of Severity perpendicular to Gimel/Luna).

"And the voice said..." descriptive of 6=5 grade.

The Voice of the Beast 666 is here just a tremendous roaring (martial), which is also articulate.

Pentagram: Five-fold mystery. Make a PERFECT MAN (pentagram) by folding up his 10 consecutive qualities (Sephira) into a single symmetrical symbol (Star). But then that Star must be blotted out in the heart of Hadit—i.e., the "Point-of-View,    (!)

The totality of experiences has amount to Perfection; there is no more need of a phenomenal universe. "For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union." Under the shadow of thy wings—*Sub umbra alarum tuarum Adonai quies et felicitas*—is in the Fama Fraternitas as well as the Golden Dawn Neophyte Ritual [Dee incorporation] but here refers to 5=6 initiation. True wisdom is under night of pan. True medicine wine of death (AL). glory of god by no means (?) extends to void - you're on your own? These are on tomb of C.R. Mercury, Sulphur, Salt. IXº OTO reference. 3 years = 156 weeks, the time it takes to assimilate the 8=3 initiation. [It had been 156 weeks since a December 1906 astral vision in which Crowley was invited to partake in the Abyss/masters - the one of them eating the guy.] Letters TARO around the tomb of CR (VVVVV). The Tree of Life is ruled by three rings (wand of Hierophant, Liber Reguli)—Supernal Love (Daleth); Formula of Babalon and Beast (Teth); and the formula hinted at in Liber AL (? The whole thing?) By the four letters TARO you an do anything, white or black (Tree of Life). Roof of Aethyr is Mars.

25. But there are excavations of excavations. (The excavation is the receptacle, like that which is hollowed out, or carved out, like a cave, or any other receptacle. Therefore all receptacles are inferior with respect to the superiors, among which the "shells" hold the last place, which here are described, which are) under the form of a vast serpent extending this way and that. (Concerning this serpent the author of the "Royal Valley" speaks thus in his "Treatise of the Shells." The fragments of the receptacles, which have fallen into the world of Creation, of Formation, and of Action, therein exist from the Outer; and judgments are more consonant to these, which are called profane, and have their habitation in the middle space between the Holy and the Unclean. And from the head is formed that great dragon which is in the sea, and is the sea-serpent, which is, however, not so harmful as the earthly one. And this dragon hath been castrated since his crest (or membrum genitale), together with his mate, have been repressed, and thence have been formed four hundred desirable worlds. And this dragon hath in his head a

p. 51

nostril (after the manner of whales) in order that he may receive influence, and in himself he containeth all other dragons, concerning which it is said: "Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons upon the waters" (Ps. lxxiv. 13). And here the idea or universal form of all the shells is understood, which encompasseth the seven inferior emanations of the queen after the manner of a serpent, as well from the right as from the left and from every side.)

[The excavation or receptacle of a Sephira is that quality whereby it receives the supernal influence from that which immediately precedes it; hence each Sephira has a double quality of receiving and of transmitting, which passes through the four worlds in each which the Sephiroth exist, though in gradually decreasing light. (See Table subjoined.) The "shells," Qlipoth, are the demons, in whom again is a form of the Sephiroth, distorted and averse. This great dragon which is here described is evidently identical with the leviathan of Job. He is the executor of judgment, the centripetal force, the old serpent ever seeking to penetrate into Paradise; finally, in a more exoteric sense he is Satan and the devil, the accusing one. In the Sepher Yetzirah, a most important qabalistical book, he is called Theli, ThLI, the dragon. Now, by Gematria. ThLI = 400 + 30 + 10 = 440; and if we "repress his crest"--i.e., take away the first letter, which is Th, Tau,--400, there will remain LI = 40 = M, Mem, the water. The "400 desirable worlds" are the numerical value of Th, and signify the power of the Tetragrammaton on the material plane (See note to section 21, foregoing). There is much alchemical symbolism contained in the "Siphra Dtzenioutha." The "Seven Inferior Emanations" of the queen, are the seven lower Sephiroth --viz., Chesed, Geburah, Tiphereth, Netzach, Hod. Yesod, and Malkuth; or Microprosopus and his bride, the king and queen. Shells," Qliphoth, are the evil spirits.]

26. His tail is in his head (that is, he holdeth his tail in his mouth, in order that he may form a circle, since he is said to encompass holiness). He transferreth his head to behind the shoulders (that is, he raiseth his head at the back of the bride of Microprosopus, where is the place of most severe judgments), and he is despised (since in him is the extremity of judgments and severities, whence wrath is the attribute of his forms). He watcheth (that

p. 52

is, he accurately searcheth out and seeketh in what place he may gain an entry into holiness. And he is concealed (as if laying traps; since he insinuateth himself into the inferiors, by whose sins he hath access to the holy grades, where the carrying out of judgments is committed to him.) He is manifested in one of the thousand shorter days. (Numbers are called days, and numbers of the inferior world short days; among which tens are attributed to the factive, on account of their decimal numeration; hundreds to the formative, since they are numbers of the light of their author, and draw their existence from the tens; but thousands to the creative, for the same reason. But that dragon hath about this his. most powerful location, whence, if a defect occurreth only in one numeration of that system through the fault of the inferiors, he is immediately manifest, and thus commenceth his accusations before the throne of glory.)

[Here is the origin of the well-known symbol of a serpent holding his tail in his mouth, like a circle--the serpent of Saturn. The reason that he raiseth his head behind the shoulders of the bride (Malkuth) is because he is. so to speak, not only the executor of judgment, but also the destroyer; destruction as opposed to creation, death as opposed to life. For the whole Sephiroth are represented as being the balance of mercy and justice, and the tenth Sephira is especially of the nature of justice, as also is Geburah. the fifth. He is concealed, because he is not called into action till justice requires him. The term "decimal numeration" of course refers to the ten Sephiroth. The presence of the serpent when revealed, is an accusation, because it shows that the balance is destroyed; just as in a watch, if one of the wheels be injured, irregularity is at once manifested. Now, life, when it consists of birth into another form, necessarily implies death in the previous form. The throne of glory is the Briatic world.]

27. There are swellings in his scales (that is, like as in a crocodile; because great in him is the heaping together of judgments). His crest keepeth its own place (that is, there is in him no further power of hastening to things beyond in the Outer).

p. 53

[There is in the destroyer no "hastening to the outer," because he is centripetal and not centrifugal.]

28. But his head is broken by the waters of the great sea. (The great sea is wisdom, the fountain of mercy and loving-kindness; which, if it sendeth down its influence, judgments are pacified, and the hurtful power of the shells is restricted); like as it is written, Ps. lxxiv. 13: "Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons by the waters."

["The waters of the great sea," are the influence of the supernal mother, Binah, of whom Malkuth is the reflection. But Binah receives the influence of Chokmah. See Introduction.]

29. They were two (male and female, whence the text of the Psalm speaketh of the dragons in the plural number; but when the plural number is given in its least form, two only are understood). They are reduced into one (for the female leviathan hath been slain, lest they should seek to multiply judgments). Whence the word ThNINM, Thenanim (in the before-mentioned passage of the Psalm), is written in a defective form (purposely to denote that restriction).

[I may refer the reader to the Talmud for further information regarding Jewish ideas of the Leviathan. Thenanim is written in a defective form, because the letter I of the plural is omitted. Written fully, it should be ThNINIM, instead of ThNINM.]

30. (But it is said) heads (in the plural number, for the purpose of denoting a vast multitude, as well of species as of individuals in that genus); like as it is written, Ezek. i. 22: "And a likeness as a firmament above the heads of the living creature." (Where also the word living creature, ChIH, Chiah, is put in the singular as a genus of angels; and heads in the plural for the purpose of denoting species and innumerable individuals.)

["Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons (Thenanim) by the waters." It must be remembered that this dragon is said by the author of the "Royal Valley" to be the king of all the "shells"

p. 54

or demons. Now, the demons are divided into ten classes. corresponding to the ten Sephiroth, but in an averse form, and are called in the book, "Beth Elohim," the "impure Sephiroth." The heads of the leviathan (cf. the Lernæan Hydra which Hercules slew) are probably these. Compare the description of the beast in Revelation.]

Cancer/Sagittarius/Scorpio.
The Chariot/Air/Death.

Comment: Here is the First Key to the formula of Horus, a sevenfold arrangement. A shadow of Horus declares his nature.

LIN=ChSN, ruler of Air, Strength. 118 = 2 x 59, Brethren. Twins concealed in HeruRH. Lilith/Samael. First formula of Horus is that of Babalon, as He is yet within HER womb. [Note 10th Aire, PARAOAN-I’m not there yet]

[esh: Mercurial symbolism. Also solar symbolism—high/deeper version of the 5=6 GD initiation. Note outer/inner initiations. LIN= 9, Tzaddi, “Sun of the Morning, Chief Among the Mighty” (see line 21 of aethyr, Harpocrates on lotus), emerging kingship. LIN = Paths of Cheth, Samekh, Nun: Openings to Binah, Tiphareth and then Tiphareth with reference to Binah {50 Gates}]

Into the stone: The table of 49 squares. (Chanokh: SAAIME/SBHDIII table—this is presumably the 7 names of Sigillum Dei Aemeth i.e. Babalon, arranged into a magical square—or this square likely predated the Sigillum? See Skinner.). {7 planetary angels are drawn from this table.} Surrounded by angels [Gods down to elementals]. Each letter composed of 49 other letters, in a language similar to that of Honorius/Theban [See Agrippa—~1531, pre-Dee and Dee influential]. (!!) But cannot be read. Now comes PAN as an angel uniting 7 planets [9th Aethyr] [many colors, but = Chokmah; as gray of chokmah = all colors. Also Samekh = rainbow]. Aire beocmes light and drips dew [Supernal Lion-Serpent in Menstruum of Liquid Pearl {Gimel?}] [JAE starts calling this a “quasi-physical” kundalini phenomenon here are starts babbling about John Denver wtf. Mentioned in GD 4=7?]. Dew = enormous globs, shining like moon, perfectly transparent and luminous.  [falling yods. Gen 27:38]

49 letters of tablet = 49 kinds of cosmos in every thought of God. 49 interpretations of every cosmos, every interpretation manifested 49 ways. So 49 calls, to each of which there are 49 visions. [Bowie when I’m typing: “Must have been touching close to 94.”] And each visions = 49 elements, except 10th, which is accursed, and has 42. [Doug Adams??] [42=Demiurge in Gen I, assessors in hall of dead, AMA Sterile Mother, Terror and Destruction, Loss, Earth of Malkuth. 10th Aethyr etc.] [Genesis I as Demiurge “evilly” creating imperfection from perfection.]
[JAE: Implicit call 0 is silence. {DeSalvo 49th call/table?} Total elements would = 1463, 7 x 209, 209 = HDR, The Pearl]

Solar Child develops from the Dew. 

Standing in form of Kneph, 0^0 omniform zero, winged egg from which all positive manifestation comes. 

[VII prologue… samadhi]

Looking into liquid surface of egg, all names of God, even not known to angels, crowd about.

7 senses -> 1 sense, then dissolved into itself in samadhi [sagittarius?]. Declare it all [all sag?] No link to Perdurabo. In samadhi behind veil of Table —Table as “Veil of Infinite”. Arms in form of cross, extending into infinity, with himself as point within it (Nuit/Hadit)—this is the birth of form. 
Encircled by immense sphere of many-colored bands, sphere of Sephiroth projected in the three dimensions—the birth of death. [Saturn?] [Death as self extended into negative circle/sphere of Nuit instead of positive balanced cross] [JL: This is an excellent summary of NOX formula vs LVX formula. One simply sees BEYOND the limits of the Cross of manifestation into infinity and then emptiness, i.e. Via Negativa, NOX.]
In center within is glowing sun—the birth of hell, the secret center of self [Liber Aleph]. “One perceives one’s Star as one’s True Self.” (!?!?! whoa dude. Also… VIIº OTO? Star as solar-phallic? WHOA DUDE)

Hell = same root as all covered/concealed stuff [JAE] Crucifixtion as Nuit/Hadit/Heru-Ra-Ha.

It is the virtue of the table to sweep everything away. 

Aethyr:
	I: Vision = Sag, Rainbow as 7fold projection
	L: Purity = Luna decreasing in Cancer. Active Luna always purifies, passive evil [active reflects sun not phantoms of night]. 
	N: Energy = Mars in Scorpio, energy which forms vision (in Taurus would cause action)

Mental analysis causes author to break into dispersion (333). Mental nature of aethyr… letters of Table are all wrong, shadows of shadows. Whoso beholdeth table is light=ARARITA, transmuted = ATh RAIAR, yod girt by suns tending inwardly upon it. RAIAR = Mercury by way of Bet. Kether and Sol are not light, as light is a duplex vibration energized by them and is thereby of their Messenger, Mercury (!!)

Voice of Aethyr is ceaseless thundering of word AUMGN, outside time. Amen continuous. Eye, Ayin, glory so great it cannot be manifested by any positive means (yes… intuitively perceiving this while reading, outside reason).

Table recedes - two angels above him with black wings - and he is shut up into Pastos of Christian Rosenkreutz (7 SIDES = PENTACLE OF BABALON = 49-FOLD TABLE - Demonstrating consistency of imagery through Dee>Rosicrucians>Golden Dawn even if reconstructed by Crowley in his mind/outside time?) Heru-Ra-Ha speaks from egg of blue. Flaming rosy cross before him. I have opened my eye and the universe dissolves. Upper eyelid force, lower eyelid matter, gazing into seven spaces (sephira) there is naught (emptiness). [JAE: This is HGA of Crowley]

[In GD init Crowley found his initiator in Pastos, here place are swapped.]

Horus slays Sobek, crowned with mixed forces of Aquarius, opposite in Zodiac to Leo (sign of Horus). 

Energy of Horus destroys *but must be withdrawn afterward* or he continues to vitalize with his energy (!!!!!!!!!!) (practical psychic defense). (Enterer/Silence - fucking drill it down.) The coherence of the broken matter must be withdrawn.

Harpo on lotus, fortress against water demon. gather yourselves unto me on lotus oh you sons of the morning (luciferians?) Horus chases Osiris into Ammenti and then follows him there so that his reign may be established even in the realms of death.  Death is now Life Triumphant in New Aeon, not by resurrection but by its own essence (?)

Thelemic afterlife: He is eternal and perceives himself the Universe by virtue of categories of Life and Death, which are not real, but subjective conditions of perception like time and space. “Forms of his artistic presentation.”

Osiris was tricked into death by magick and had to overcome it with the formula IAO (Christ, Mithras, resurrecting gods, etc…. similarity to theories of Yugas).

The table reappears and says you’ve translated the vision into reason, this causes new Falls. 

Mark 2:25-26New International Version (NIV)
25 He answered, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? 26 In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”

i.e. profaning the sacred… connection between SHEW-BREAD and SHEW-STONE of Dee? I.e. storming heaven unlawfully…

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showbread

This cannot be re-opened except by virtue of ARARITA—i.e. equating and identifying every idea with its opposite, thereby being released from fixed truth and completely withdrawing from Ruach. See Chapters of ARARITA for the method: Thesis > Antithesis > Quintessence > Withdrawal > Erasure in the method itself > Reappearance in form appointed by Adept. 

[i.e. since reason and ratiocination profane the “shrine” of understanding [Binah beyond Da’ath], one must exit the Ruach completely via the ARARITA method before being admitted to the “shrine” of the Table (and hence the 3rd order?) Indeed the Sevenfold seal is a symbol of Babylon, Binah, and Babylon triumphs over Choronzon. {The Dragon?}]

Even though joined to inmost mystery of heaven, one must accomplish sevenfold task of earth, even as thou safest angels from greatest to least. Sense shall be darkened and shrine re-veiled after you take back.

If your analytical methods cannot destroy Illusion, try harder, motherfucker. 

SatChitAnanda, 4 powers of Sphinx. Being/Knowledge/Bliss, Will/Courage/Wisdom/Silence. [7 = ARARITA??] That which, being all these, is greater than all these [is this the secret 8th head of the Beast?]

Sorrow upon seeing world as it is (Dukkha, Binah).

“The Vision and the Voice stands alone in the world’s spiritual literature as a singularly elegant fusion of religious doctrine. It represents a kind of calculus of religious concepts, an advanced mathematics of magic and mysticism, both subsuming and overthrowing the world’s religious symbolism.”

JAE says this is the true promise of the Lord of the New Aeon: “Behold! Where are now the darkness and the terror and the lamentation? For ye are born into the new Aeon; ye shall not suffer death. Bind up your girdles of gold! Wreath yourselves with garlands of my unfading flowers! In the nights we will dance together, and in the morning we will go forth to war; for, as my Father liveth that was dead, so do I live and shall never die.”

Aethyric imagery past this point is beyond good/evil duality, fundamental logic, being obliged to think of state of mind, or individual, being true to itself. 

Cabalistic communication by taste: MEDONEStL UIEOEMThERIONS. Crowley: “The Earth is sick of love; with disease and death is she sick… the natural lust, fierce as it is, is not enough; virgins, boys, women (make man) sick, weak of semen, and sick. The earth shall be cured of her sickness by true Art-of-Sun, and thine own pleasure(s), oh Thou …, shall abolish the world’s woe, and bring on the Age of Righteousness.” [Seminal retention? Deeper meaning of semen? VITRIOL? Logos?]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abomination_of_desolation

“motionless abomination” (see Aethyr). Designation of Jupiter?

According to 1 Maccabees 1:54, the abomination was erected on the altar of burnt offering [ Qliphoth ]

1 Maccabees[edit]
According to 1 Maccabees 1:54, the abomination was erected on the altar of burnt offering.[4]
1 Maccabees 1:54 "Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side;"
1 Maccabees 6:7 "Also that they had pulled down the abomination, which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his city Bethsura."

The rabbinical consensus is that the expression refers to the desecration of the Second Temple (Herod's Temple) by the erection of a Zeus statue in its sacred precincts byAntiochus IV Epiphanes.[6][7] Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to Manasseh, who is reported to have set up "a carved image … in the house of God".[8][9]
Church Father John Chrysostom understood this to refer to the armies that surrounded Jerusalem and the factions fighting within it which preceded the destruction of the city.[10]

The 1 Maccabees usage of the term points to the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in the mid-2nd century BC. Specifically, he set up an altar to Zeus in the Second Temple in Jerusalem, and sacrificed swine on it around the year 167 BC.[citation needed] Many modern scholars believe that Daniel 9:27, 11:31 and 12:11 are examples of vaticinium ex eventu (prophecies after the event) relating to Antiochus.[11][12]
Many modern Biblical scholars[13] conclude that Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14 are prophecies after the event about the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70 by the Roman generalTitus.[14] Some scholars, including Hermann Detering,[15] see these verses as a vaticinium ex eventu about Emperor Hadrian's attempt to install the statue of Jupiter Capitolinus on the site of the ruined Jewish Temple in Jerusalem leading to the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132-135 AD.


Preterists believe that Jesus quoted this prophecy in Mark 13:14 as referring to an event in his 1st century disciples' immediate future, such as the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD.[16][17]
One commentator relates the prophecy to the actions of Caligula c. 40 AD when he ordered that a golden statue depicting himself as Zeus incarnate be set up in the Temple in Jerusalem.[18] This prospect however, never came to fruition since he was assassinated in 41 AD along with his wife and daughter.[19]
Peter Bolt, head of New Testament at Moore Theological College, believes that the abomination of desolation in Mark 13 refers to the crucifixion of the Son of God; in other words, Jesus is referring to his own impending death.[20]


If Abomination of Desolation = Zeus/Io Pater statue in the Second Temple = Chesed or Demiurge. [As here seen.] Also “changeless abomination”] (changeless nature of imagery. Also the demiurgic figure is seen on a throne behind pillars with sphinxes, which doesn’t *really* resemble the second temple, but is vaguely suggestive of a similar setup


0=2?

From this figure proceed the elements (again 4, chesed, and demiurgos 718.) But why Stele?

“Only those who accept nothing from me can bring anything to me.”

The muttering heard from the idol is the APE OF THOTH; the being on throne has not spoken at all.  

KETHER, silence -> THOTH, false speech [as not silence]
			 APE OF THOTH, caricature/Qliphoth of false speech. -> According to the Ape, his speech is true, because he falsifies falsehood (but wouldn’t it rather be progressive degeneration?)

Ape of Thoth = babbling mind that gets in way of the Silence of the Most High [Bet, Mayan, magician in house of god]

[JAE: Truth = AMTh. Whatsoever of truth that gains voice is a lie, as dual]

***From now on, all statements in Aethyrs speak the language of the Neschemah and not Ruach [we also transition into Briah in next aethyr], meaning that they are paradoxical statements, and must be reverse and reversed again and again, and are true and false at once [NEITHER-NEITHER LANGUAGE]

Signs up to 7=4 but no further he has them not. This is beyond Adeptus Exemptus and Crowley’s then extent of initiation.

So he was wrong in Wake World to suggest that an MT could pass to higher temples. Distances between grades increase.

Angel: Seeing this “God” (the man behind the curtain) is the Ordeal X—“the horror and loneliness of the First” (Kether), now he can go into the world as the prophet of new Aeon, whether Kether is Not [i.e. 0=2, Kether is the child of any marriage of one particular Hadit with one particular aspect of Nuit, and there are therefore infinite Kethers, and all marriages also produce a twin: H+Y=H+V. Third Being/Third Mind (Kether) and also an ecstasy or dissolution produced by the same event. Magical and Mystical results of act of Love Under Will. 

The voice of Ape of Thoth is pulse of heart and laboring of breast.

Jupiter. Chashmalim (choir). Gather into Wheel of Fortune = 49 wheels set at different angles composing a sphere. When rays from 2 wheels meet, blinding flash of glory. [ 49 =table. 7 is inferiors, feminine perfection. 3 x 49 = 147, the four names of god used in LBRP(!) 4fold regimen of YHVH: 3 x 7 x 7 [Why 3? Gunas? Dinah? 3 of four elements with Earth implied?]

[Trumpets cause all things to manifest at once = Malkuth, 10; 10,000 things {10 x 1,000 or 10^3}. 49 is also the value of “the Lamb.” HTLH {but this includes initial Heh… uhh?}]

[JAE: KHR = 225. Same as Latin “Facito Voluntatem Tuam,” “Do what the wilt,” and “Transerat a me calyx itse,” take this cup from me. (Cup?). Also child and I am in greek. 225 is also 15^2.]

[Wheel: Purusha and Prakrit, seer and seen. Wheel: I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. "Come unto me" is a foolish word: for it is I that go.” Kaph wheel, yod axle. This is a Briatic expression of prakriti, Nature.]

Spun by hand (Yod, Kaph, 20, Jupiter), Spermatozoon, Hadit… KAph = peh + kaph = yod * yod, Kaph and Peh are Kteis and Phallus whose union releases Yod. Universe set into motion by Love Under Will. “By “the wheel spinning in the spire” is meant the manifestation of magical force, the spermatozoon in the conical phallus.” (Book of Lies Cap 43)

You = Kether = Primal turnings [14º SR ring—Yod in triangle, or hand and three guns of wheel. Yod also axle, meaning it is turned by axle inside us.]

Jovial God. 

Proper beasts of Wheel: Rim is vivid emerald snake. Center is scarlet heart. Scarlet of heart and green of snake are more vivid than blinding white brilliance of Wheel (higher key scale?) Liber LXV imagery—3:17-18. At the top is Agnus Dei, lamb and flag; also we have beasts: wolf, raven. Lamb is brightest—it is the Great Deceiver. [It seems pure and white, so therefore distracts people from getting to center of wheel.] 

	WOLF/NEPHESCH/MERCURY: Betrays greedy and treacherous (Lust of flesh)
	RAVEN/RUACH/SULPHUR: Betrays melancholy and dishonest [No hostile force is hurtful… enemy is always oneself.] (Lust of mind) (Ravens of Dispersion = A’arab Zareq = Qlipha of Hod)
	LAMB/NESCHAMAH/SALT: Deceives the very elect. (Simulations of pure prompting of the soul)

Lamb as drunk on blood of saints, the Chief of the lying spirits. Feasts on the sentimental type of aspirant (sentiment as “vile parody” of Neschamah, polluted by least virile elements of Nephesch [!!!!], leading to corruption of sin and vicarious atonement doctrines) 

[These trials: “There is a word to say about the Hierophantic task. Behold! there are three ordeals in one, and it may be given in three ways. The gross must pass through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones in the highest. Thus ye have star & star, system & system; let not one know well the other! “]

Overcome by ABRAHADABRA and ARARITA and NOX (210). X in O represents the reduction of the Dyad to Unity by Love under Will, and thence by 0 to dissolution in Nuit., destroying all positive symbols so one can unify in Nuit. Nuit is the True Wheel. Unity consciousness above abyss. [lightning in Atu in Thoth]

Liquid flame of pale gold (Ut). (32º SR?) Solar dieties as springing from the jupiter of the wheel/hand.  More change/stability paradox. Dance of Shiva. 

[More Crowley distancing by hovering in Yetzirah so he can write.]

“Angel is I” so makes hard to grasp. I cannot get into I. Therefore mahasatipattha, an a-centric meditation process, must be undertaken before invocations of HGA. 

K&C of HGA. Crowley’s True Will is to lead men to K&C. He discovered this by Sammasati while in China:

In the Noble Eightfold Path, the practice leading to the complete cessation of Unsatisfactoriness, Sammasati is counted as the second factor of the Samadhi Section, the 'Higher Mental Training'. The usual definition of sammasati given in the Discourses is as follows:
"Bhikkhus. What is sammasati? This is call sammasati, namely, that a bhikkhu in this Dhamma Vinaya:
"1. Contemplates the body in the body with effort, sampajañña and sati, eradicating covetousness and distress with regard to the world;[1]
"2. Contemplates feeling in feelings with effort, sampajañña and sati, eradicating covetousness and distress with regard to the world;
"3. Contemplates the mind in the mind with effort, sampajañña and sati, eradicating covetousness and distress with regard to the world;
"4. Contemplates dhammas[2] in dhammas with effort, sampajañña and sati, eradicating covetousness and distress with regard to the world." [D.II.313]
    Another definition, which appears in the Abhidhamma texts, is as follows:
"What is sammasati? Sati means to bear in mind or bring to mind. Sati is the state of recollecting, the state of remembering, the state of non-fading, the state of non-forgetting. Sati means the sati that is a Spiritual Faculty, the sati that is a Spiritual Power, Sammasati, the Sati that is an Enlightenment Factor, that which is a Path Factor and that which is related to the Path. This is what is called sammasati." [Vbh.105, 286]
    Sammasati, as defined in the Discourses, is a synonym for the principles of Dhamma known as the Four Satipatthana. The four elements of this group have the abbreviated names of:
	1.	Kayanupassana (contemplation or mindfulness of the body);
	2.	Vedananupassana (contemplation or mindfulness of feelings);
	3.	Cittanupassana (contemplation or mindfulness of mind);
	4.	Dhammanupassana (contemplation or mindfulness of dhammas)

Greek, ICHTHYS - (Jesus fish/ vesicle) (traditionally a notariqon of “Iesous Christos Theou Uios Soter”, but here stated it is not this). 

“This explanation is given among others by Augustine in his Civitate Dei,[7] where he notes that the generating sentence " Ἰησοῦς Χρειστὸς [sic] Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτήρ" has 27 letters, i.e. 3 x 3 x 3, which in that age indicated power. (This suggestion is obviously spurious, resulting from Augustine's ignorance of Greek.) [8] Augustine quotes also an ancient text from the Sibylline oracles[9] whose verses are an acrostic of the generating sentence.”


[JL: Fish here also = Pisces, aeon of Pisces.]

JAE and Crowley tie themselves in knots here, and Crowley never found a solution. The numerical explanation may be as simple as Ἰησοῦς Χρειστὸς Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτήρ = 27 letters = 3x3x3, i.e. the Christic doctrine of Augustine in City of God is identified as of Choronzom.

The City of God [aka City of God Against the Pagans —note the similarities to earlier references to the Abomination of Desolation is Zeus/Io Pater in the 2nd Temple] was written as a political apology for Christianity, saying it did not destroy (disperse) Rome, and posits eternal warfare between God and the Devil, and that the Catholic Church is aligned with God, who uses it and allied countries to fight the Devil. 

City of God Book 18, Chapter 23:

Of the Erythræan Sibyl, Who is Known to Have Sung Many Things About Christ More Plainly Than the Other Sibyls.[1]
Some say the Erythræan sibyl prophesied at this time. Now Varro declares there were many sibyls, and not merely one. This sibyl of Erythræ certainly wrote some things concerning Christ which are quite manifest, and we first read them in the Latin tongue in verses of bad Latin, and unrhythmical, through the unskillfulness, as we afterwards learned, of some interpreter unknown to me. For Flaccianus, a very famous man, who was also a proconsul, a man of most ready eloquence and much learning, when we were speaking about Christ, produced a Greek manuscript, saying that it was the prophecies of the Erythræan sibyl, in which he pointed out a certain passage which had the initial letters of the lines so arranged that these words could be read in them: ᾽Ιησοῦς Χριστος Θεοῦ υιὸς σωτηρ, which means, “Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour.” 

[Flaccanius is unknown outside of Augustine, though is mentioned elsewhere in Aug as criticizing fortune-telling: https://books.google.com/books?id=ReU2M8cLtGcC&pg=PA1200&lpg=PA1200&dq=Flaccianus&source=bl&ots=wkAsluyKGc&sig=OyZvmGZKjPTmBaJd4Sb1oHTwOII&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAmoVChMIsqycntDqxgIVzSmICh0xNgW-#v=onepage&q=Flaccianus&f=false]
And these verses, of which the initial letters yield that meaning, contain what follows as translated by some one into Latin in good rhythm:
Ι Judgment shall moisten the earth with the sweat of its standard, 
Η Ever enduring, behold the King shall come through the ages, 
Σ Sent to be here in the flesh, and Judge at the last of the world. 
Ο O God, the believing and faithless alike shall behold Thee 
Υ Uplifted with saints, when at last the ages are ended. 
Σ Seated before Him are souls in the flesh for His judgment.  Χ Hid in thick vapors, the while desolate lieth the earth. 
Ρ Rejected by men are the idols and long hidden treasures; 
Ε Earth is consumed by the fire, and it searcheth the ocean and heaven; 
Ι Issuing forth, it destroyeth the terrible portals of hell. 
Σ Saints in their body and soul freedom and light shall inherit; 
Τ Those who are guilty shall burn in fire and brimstone for ever. 
Ο Occult actions revealing, each one shall publish his secrets; 
Σ Secrets of every man’s heart God shall reveal in the light.  Θ Then shall be weeping and wailing, yea, and gnashing of teeth; 
Ε Eclipsed is the sun [Yesod-Tiphareth=Samekh], and silenced the stars in their chorus. 
Ο Over and gone is the splendor of moonlight [Yesod], melted the heaven, 
Υ Uplifted by Him are the valleys, and cast down the mountains.  Υ Utterly gone among men are distinctions of lofty and lowly. 
Ι Into the plains rush the hills, the skies and oceans are mingled. 
Ο Oh, what an end of all things! earth broken in pieces shall perish; 
Σ .... Swelling together at once shall the waters and flames flow in rivers.  Σ Sounding the archangel’s trumpet shall peal down from heaven, 
Ω Over the wicked who groan in their guilt and their manifold sorrows. 
Τ Trembling, the earth shall be opened, revealing chaos and hell. 
Η Every king before God shall stand in that day to be judged. 
Ρ Rivers of fire and brimstone shall fall from the heavens.

[JL NOTE: This bears extreme similarity to the English text of the 19th Call:

THE CALL OR KEY OF THE THIRTY AETHYRS

O YE Heavens which dwell in the first Air, yea are mighty in the parts of 
the Earth, and execute the Judgment of the Highest! Unto you it is said: 
Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the 
brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth,
and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding to 
dispose all things according to the Providence of Him that sitteth on 
the Holy Throne, and rose up in the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be 
governed by her parts, and let there be Division in her, that the glory of her
may be always drunken, and vexed in itself. Her course, let it run with the 
Heavens; and as an handmaid let her serve them. One season, let it confound 
another, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her 
members, let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one Creature 
equal with another. The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them forget their Names. The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His buildings, let them become Caves for the beasts of the Field! Confound her understanding with darkness! For why? it repenteth me that I have made Man. One while let her be known, and another while a stranger: because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that is fallen.

O ye Heavens, arise! The lower heavens beneath you, let them serve you! 
Govern those that govern! Cast down such as fall. Bring forth with those 
that increase, and destroy the rotten. No place let it remain in one number.
Add and diminish until the stars be numbered. Arise! Move! and appear before the Covenant of His mouth, which He hath sworn unto us in His Justice. Open the Mysteries of your Creation, and make us partakers of THE UNDEFILED KNOWLEDGE.]

And, of course, 3^3 = Coronzom, who is *overcome* past ZAX, making this a “blessing”—that everything should be as it is below the abyss, though seen as perfection from the Supernal world. Also not the Erytherean sibil = Binah or Babalon. 

In these Latin verses the meaning of the Greek is correctly given, although not in the exact order of the lines as connected with the initial letters; for in three of them, the fifth, eighteenth, and nineteenth, where the Greek letter Υ occurs, Latin words could not be found beginning with the corresponding letter, and yielding a suitable meaning. So that, if we note down together the initial letters of all the lines in our Latin translation except those three in which we retain the letter Υ in the proper place, they will express in five Greek words this meaning, “Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour.” And the verses are twenty-seven, which is the cube of three. For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if tripled, so as to rise from the superficial square to the cube, comes to twenty-seven. But if you join the initial letters of these five Greek words, ᾽Ιησοῦς Χριστος Θεοῦ υἰὸς σωτήρ, which mean, “Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour,” they will make the word ἰχδὺς, that is, “fish,” in which word Christ is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that is, to exist, without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth of waters.[2]
[Abyss, waters of Binah = Christ as fish within Binah]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibyl = frenzied women w ptsd = Sumerian temple whores, Babalon

[Cumaean Sibyl[edit]
Main article: Cumaean Sibyl
The sibyl who most concerned the Romans was the Cumaean Sibyl, located near the Greek city of Naples, whom Virgil's Aeneas consults before his descent to the lower world (Aeneid book VI: 10). Burkert notes (1985, p 117) that the conquest of Cumae by the Oscans in the 5th century destroyed the tradition, but provides a terminus ante quem for a Cumaean sibyl. It was she who supposedly sold to Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, the original Sibylline books. Christians were especially impressed with the Cumaean Sibyl, for in Virgil's Fourth Eclogue she foretells the coming of a savior – possibly a flattering reference to the poet's patron – whom Christians identified as Jesus.[18][19][20]]

But this sibyl, whether she is the Erythræan, or, as some rather believe, the Cumæan, in her whole poem, of which this is a very small portion, not only has nothing that can relate to the worship of the false or feigned gods, but rather speaks against them and their worshippers in such a way that we might even think she ought to be reckoned among those who belong to the city of God. Lactantius also inserted in his work the prophecies about Christ of a certain sibyl, he does not say which. But I have thought fit to combine in a single extract, which may seem long, what he has set down in many short quotations. She says, “Afterward He shall come into the injurious hands of the unbelieving, and they will give God buffets with profane hands, and with impure mouth will spit out envenomed spittle; but He will with simplicity yield His holy back to stripes. And He will hold His peace when struck with the fist, that no one may find out what word, or whence, He comes to speak to hell; and He shall be crowned with a crown of thorns. And they gave Him gall for meat, and vinegar for His thirst: they will spread this table of inhospitality. For thou thyself, being foolish, hast not understood thy God, deluding the minds of mortals, but hast both crowned Him with thorns and mingled for Him bitter gall. But the veil of the temple shall be rent; and at midday it shall be darker than night for three hours. And He shall die the death, taking sleep for three days; and then returning from hell, He first shall come to the light, the beginning of the resurrection being shown to the recalled.” Lactantius made use of these sibylline testimonies, introducing them bit by bit in the course of his discussion as the things he intended to prove seemed to require, and we have set them down in one connected series, uninterrupted by comment, only taking care to mark them by capitals, if only the transcribers do not neglect to preserve them hereafter. Some writers, indeed, say that the Erythræan sibyl was not in the time of Romulus, but of the Trojan war.


"The City of God Against the Pagans" by St. Augustine is a cornerstone of Western thought, in which the critical Catholic theologist decries the number of teenage Wiccans with black nail polish, pentagram necklaces and bo-staffs that are always playing "Magic: The Gathering" in front of the Cinnabon in the mall food court by his house. It was followed three years later by a less popular work, "The City of God Against the Furries."

Nails = 3 desires (vau vau vau 666) = desire for light, life, love [gunther: LLLL at base of pyramid of aspirant] [This applies only to this step, not to Man of Earth]
Thorns = Thoughts
Whips = Regrets
Wine = Unsteadiness in ecstasy (See Liber AL)
Spear = Attachment

Free self from all attachment, desires, mind. (Buddhism)

Christ as Bat, thieves as two children (ATU XIX? Inversion of Sun. Qlipha of Resh/Tiphareth?) Night full of hideous things and howling (Goetia?) If you change so much as a letter the holy word is blasphemed (fill/kill). This is the “empty shell” of mystery of ZEN [JL: Indeed - the Qlipha of Resh or Tiphareth in Briah]


Reference to Exodus 33:22-23: Many Adepts’s eyes have failed before the glory of thy countenance
“22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:
23 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.”
Portal signs given. 72 whirling signs of fiery light (Shemham - related to “Howlings” mentioned before as being attributed to the Goetia)

Parting of Veil = Opening Briah

Latin QBL Simplex, 72 = ABIEGNUS. also IGNIS DEI and VACUUM

72 = A’aB, secret nature of Atziluth. [Meatus/Word?] Cone of Phallus of Iacchus, with ruby pyramid [Phallus, 831, 3 x 277, magician, lunar white wand, NVRA, MQL LBNH, ChRTM, ARIN the Ark, related mathematically to Great Pyramid of Cheops/Gizeh. (?)

KIng’s Chamber (Reception AL) is the vault of the adepts—i.e. the vault of the adepts is a “vile imitation” of it. [Liber AL, also City of Pyramids - 5=6 literally entombed in a pyramid] also = Adytum in BOTA.

Mons Cavernarum, 156 in Latin QBL (Cavern of Mt Abigenus)

4 sides + roof + floor + chamber itself = 7 [not seven sides, it is a cube—Sepher Yetzirah, cube of space, Cubical Stone, 18º SR {Rosicrucian, as the Tomb of CR in GD—earlier reflection!]. {Just as Hexagram = 7 planets because center, Sol, is implied} So Pastos = 7. No furniture or symbols. Blue brilliant light of Horus (! Babaji) Blue only because imperfection of eyes (as blue sky). [Mental awakening into “Cube” in Liber 73, Magus initiation] Million insane images (333). Expiry into NOX (VII I:40) - Crowley does not understand this. Jab at “masters” of Theosophy that lend momentary credence to their insane babble. If you do not accept annihilation, you become a black brother and batshit insane babbler.

PAstos as vacuum and angel understood as am “empty God” into which he will expire. (E and N in ZEN)

Samekh, HGA lifts up

Red = essence of Horus as stereotype of HGA

Great Pyramid height to base is 5:8, golden mean, also = Pentagram. 

Symbolic crossing of abyss, helped by angel, unlike actual where there is no help. 

THE ANGEL DEALETH NOT WITH THE LITTLE PILE OF DUST IN THE CITY OF THE PYRAMIDS, BUT WITH THE STAR THAT IS CAST FORTH TO GIVE LIGHT TO THE EARTH.

Pastos = Chamber of Annihilation, burnt up to pyramid/cone/phallus.  Pyramid within cone (purest rose/cross). representing new universe. established on 4 elements divided into 72, all categories time/space/causality etc. 

And then there is a birth chamber, given refreshments… He can’t do it yet.

Zelator initiation 2=9 is described. {Which I did} - i.e. 2=9 A.’.A.’. is Hod in Briah( or admits to?? ??)

Wait no it’s: 

NEW METHOD OF DEEPLY PARTAKING IN EACH AETHYR—in Samadhi, rather than hovering in Yetzirah(!)

Do Cadavaris, and then at end:
	Feast
	banish all elements/planets/signs/sephiroth [Liber YOD]
	Take Holy Table for altar
	Call of Aethyr written in Enochian or Alphabet of Daggers on virgin vellum
	Then conjure Aethyr
	Burn text in lamp.
	Kneel before holy table (in Dragon Asana) and you will get the vision. 

Various inks—a color scale of the Aethyrs is here give. Change not so much as the style of a letter or holy name blasphemed. 
Await the completion of 91st hour of retirement [see 91 days of Magus initiation] to open door. 

91 = 3 days, 19 hours. 

Crowley on Kelly: “No hint of the sublimity and profundity of such visions as the present series in the working of that Adept.”

Author: “For this is a holy mystery, and he that did first attain to reveal the alphabet thereof, perceived not one ten-thousandth part of the fringe that is upon its vesture.”

“loving-kindness”
