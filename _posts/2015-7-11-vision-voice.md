Assessing Aleister Crowley (Frater O.M.) and Victor Neuberg's (Frater Omnia Vincam) work with the 30 Aethyrs in 1909, Algeria. This working elucidated and developed the Book of the Law (1904) and Thelemic Holy Books (1907), particularly **Liber VII**, and firmly established the Thelemic cosmology that would later inform the O.T.O. and Gnostic Mass. Two years later, the recieved book **Liber Cheth** further developed the iconography of <p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">NOLABAB</p>, the Scarlet Woman, who appeared to Dee and Kelley after the wife-swapping incident that ended their partnership, and who appears to Crowley for the first time in the Algerian sessions. <p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">NOLABAB</p> is not a part of the Golden Dawn Enochian material that Crowley drew on for these sessions, although he may well have read of her in the Sloane folios in the British Library.(?)
