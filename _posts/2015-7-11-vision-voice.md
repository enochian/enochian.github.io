Assessing Aleister Crowley (Frater O.M.) and Victor Neuberg's (Frater Omnia Vincam) work with the 30 Aethyrs in 1909, Algeria, from November 23 to December 19 of that year. This working elucidated and developed the Book of the Law (1904) and Thelemic Holy Books (1907), particularly *Liber VII*, and firmly established the Thelemic cosmology that would later inform the O.T.O. and Gnostic Mass. Two years later, the recieved book *Liber Cheth* further developed the iconography of BABALON:
<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">BABALON</p></h3></center>
The Scarlet Woman, who also figures centrally in Revelation, appeared to Dee and Kelley after the wife-swapping incident that ended their partnership, and  appeared to Crowley for the first time in the Algerian sessions. BABALON is not a part of the Golden Dawn Enochian material that Crowley drew on for these sessions, although he may well have read of the Dee and Kelley apparition in the Sloane folios in the British Library(?); Revelation, of course, formed the core of Crowley's psychology as the Bible was his sole reading material during his adolescence in the Plymouth Bretheren, leading him to identify totally with the Beast, the consort of BABALON in Revelation. Crowley thereafter formulated BABALON as the center of his sex-magical or Tantric system, overlaying the Beast/BABALON mythos to the technical sexual magick afforded him only later, in June 1912, upon his admission to the IXº O.T.O. by Theodor Reuss.

Crowley, according to his *Confessions*, had read Casaubon before embarking on his Algerian trip with Neuberg, and had seen Dee and Kelley's scrying implements in the British Museum. Crowley's opinion of Kelley's transmissions is high:

"It is not a jargon; it has a grammar and syntax of its own. It is very much more sonorous, stately and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit, and the English translation, though in places difficult to undersatdn, contains passages of sustained sublimity that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass. To condemn Kelly as a cheating charlatan—the accepted view—is simply stupid. If he invented Enochian, and composed this superb prose, he was at worst a Chatterton with fifty times that poet's ingenuity and five hundred times his poetical genius." – *The Confessions*

##The Aethyrs
<center><img src="http://img44.xooimage.com/files/d/7/0/roue_aethyrs-d1e1f7.jpg"></center>

30 consecutive Aethyrs are outlined by Kelley—as given to Dee and Kelley on July 13, 1584 by the angels Ile and Gabriel (the latter being the same angel that disclosed the Qu'ran to the prophet Mohammed). These aethyrs are either "dominion extending in ever widening circles without and beyond the Watchtowers of the Universe," the cube of the Universe formed by the four tables; or aires simply means "climes" and they pertain to different parts of the world. Either they are spiritual landscapes, terrestrial locations or, somehow, both; Crowley and Neuberg used them as the former and not the latter.

Two mappings of the Aethyrs to the tree are given—one by the Golden Dawn, and another by a second order Golden Dawn schema mentioned in the 9th Aethyr. The first of these, which is elegant enough, is that the Aethyrs map the ten sephiroth as repeated in sequence in the latter 3 of the 4 Qabalistic worlds—Yetzirah, Briah and Atziluth, or the Astral, Causal and Spiritual planes in Theosophical language—skipping Assiah totally, as the Aethyrs are concentric spheres outwith the cube of the physical universe (Malkuth) depicted in the 30th Aethyr. 

This scheme is as follows. We have here included the astrological attributions for each (from the Enochian character attributions) as well as the "Color Scale" for the Aethyrs given in Aethyr 18, ZEN.

While each Aethyr represents one Sephira in one of the four (three of four) worlds, it should also be remembered that each sphere in each world contains a complete tree within itself, making 400 spheres total (10 Micro-Sephirah x 10 Macro-Sephirah x 4 worlds). This is my addition to Eshelman's mapping, above, and I find it works perfectly elegantly. Each Aethyr only partially partakes of the nature of its attributed sphere, but each contain a blizzard of Qabalistic symbolism, often mapping multiple paths and spheres and progressions from "station to station" on the tree. This makes perfect sense if you understand each Aethyr as subsuming *all ten* sephira within its respective sphere and world. I should also note that simply to include one sphere or path, or a combination of spheres and paths, automatically *implies* the rest of the tree, even if only a few spheres or paths make an explicit appearance. This also suggests that there is far, far more to be seen and explored in each aethyr, unless the additional micro-spheres and micro-paths stay silent and inactive in each Aethyr, resisting exploration. Although there is no real reason why this should be, or why each sphere and path could be explicitly explored with repeated callings of an Aethyr, perhaps refined and honed with traditional Qabalistic pathworkings (using pentagram and hexagram rituals along with 777 correspondences) while *within* each Aethyr. This is all theoretical as of yet.

<center><img src="http://orig02.deviantart.net/6c50/f/2009/044/9/5/tree_of_life_in_4_worlds_by_freemasons.jpg"></center>

Using this scheme, we are also left to wonder: Where is Assiah? Does Assiah simply correspond to the physical planets, elements and zodiacal regions? Are there occult methods for exploration of these? 

We may also ask, what of the Qliphoth? Early in my magical training (as a young man would), I became curious as to whether there existed a "negative world" version of the Enochian Calls, which called the Shells of the Qliphoth instead of the Spheres of the Sephirah, and nagged my teachers with this question. Reading through the *V&V*, however, I see that there are many places where the Qliphoth *do* seem to shine through—for instance, the 18th Aethyr seems to suggest the Qlipha of Tiphareth (a crucified bat) and Resh (the crucified children from the Sun Tarot card) in a nightside setting, which is explicitly referred to as the "empty shell" of the Aethyr. This suggests that the Qliphoth bleed through into the Aethyrs themselves; it also *may* put to rest another question: are the Qliphoth a "fifth world," "below" Assiah, or are there in fact Qlipha of all 400 spheres (now making 400 spheres and 400 shells total—and what of Da'ath)? This seems a more elegant theory. Additionally, we are regularly confronted with the image of the Dragon throughout the Aethyrs, who represents the Qlipha and Shells (which may also simply be the non-Supernal sephira), as elucidated in the Golden Dawn rituals and in Mathers' translation of Knorr von Rosenroth. And we must not forget the role of Coronzom himself; who (at least according to Kenneth Grant, hardly a primary source), forms a gateway into the Qliphothic Tree itself, via ZAX and/or Da'ath.

We are left to ponder the relation of the symbols of the Dragon, The Beast, BABALON and Coronzom to the Qliphoth as they relate to the Aethyrs and the overall apocalyptic drama of Revelation, the Spirit Diaries and the Book of the Law. 

More: Choronzon identifies himself as the "Head of the Dragon" (Cauda Draconis) in ZAX, reaching to Da'ath. In prior Aethyrs, Babalon and the Beast are identified as the Queen and Lord of the City of the Pyramids (Tablets), and ride each other above the Ruach; also are Binah and Chokmah, Babalon and Kaos.

Note: Any direct mapping of the Sephirah to the Aethyrs is directly contradicted by the Angel of the 12th Aethyr, who says they interpenetrate but do not directly map. (See the scheme given in Equinox IV.2?)

##Operating Procedures

Crowley's initial experiments were undertaken by modifying the 19th Call for each Aethyr, and then scrying the Spirit Vision—astral travel or willed imagination—which is outlined in the grade papers of the Golden Dawn. More precise methods, involving prepartory pentagrams and grade signs, are given in his later paper *Liber Chanokh*. None of this is found in Dee and Kelley; they are Golden Dawn methods. 9 years passed between his initial investigation of Aethyrs 30 and 29 and the Algerian experiment; this Crowley attributes to having increased his Grade or spiritual maturity to now be able to handle the visions. This factoring of the observer and their responses to messages, as well as changing information, perhaps, may be applied in reverse to Dee and Kelley. Crowley's line, again from the *Confessions*, is: "Anyone might use the Key for any Aethyr he chose, but he would either get no vision at all or expose himself to deception, and that probably of the deadly dangerous kind."

![Bou Saada](http://famouswonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Bou-Saada.jpg "Bou Saada")
<center><sub>The desert near Bou Saada</sub></center>

In Bou Saada, Algeria, Crowley employed a "great golden topaz (set in a Calvary cross of six squares, made of wood, painted vermillion) engraved with a Greek cross of five squares charged with the Rose of forty-nine petals." 49 is the number of squares in each Table. (This topaz, I am recalling off the top of my head, was stolen from Sascha Germer by the Solar Lodge in the late 1960s and subsequently lost in a fire at their ranch.) Crowley would scry into this stone physically after reciting the call. This is a marked difference from his earlier "spirit vision" methods; astral travel is essentially willed imagination with eyes closed, while scrying is looking for visuals in a physical object with eyes open. His method at this point was the simply let the Aethyr itself "overshadow" his senses as he drifted into deep trance—bringing the Aethyr to him instead of going to it. In doing this (according to Eshelman) Crowley worked to maintain an observer's perspective (in Yetzirah) instead of going fully into Samadhi upon the contents of the Aethyr. He describes this approach in the 20th Aethyr.

Recieved information was later checked by Qabalistic correspondence, Crowley's favored check against self-delusion. For Crowley, if a "spirit" code transmit accurate Qabalistic codes, and in particular if it demonstrated that it knew more Qabalah than him, then his connection to the other side was valid. When dealing with the Otherworlds, this was the equivalent of a Masonic handshake or, as we might say today, a valid password or SSH key. Later magical students, more influenced by pop psychology, like Crowley's once-secretary Israel Regardie, would have explained this by suggesting that Crowley—and, indeed, Kelley—were simply accessing deeper parts of their own brains, portions more advanced than their waking consciousness. [What does modern psychology/neuroscience say about this?]

Dee and Kelley utilized no such tests.

For Crowley, the Enochian visions subsumed *all* prior world religions, mystery cults and esoteric symbolism, all of it ultimately giving way to the incoming Aeon of Horus that had been announced by Aleister and Rose Crowley's 1904 reception of the *Book of the Law* in Cairo. *The Vision of the Voice* far surpasses this book both in length and complexity, and fully elucidates and develops the doctrine of the Aeon, which would inform Crowley's later attempts to formulate Thelema as an organized and terrestrial religion as opposed to something he had seen only while in a visionary state. That the content of Crowley's Enochian visions seem to confirm his own developing philosophy and primacy as a messianic figure immediately makes them suspect, even by Crowley's own standards—writing later, in the "Notes for an Astral Atlas" appendix to *Book 4*, Crowley warns the student that:

"Remember, then, always, but especially when dealing with the Astral Plane, that man's breath stirs the Feather of Truth. What one sees and hears is 'real' in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or created by one's personality... 

"The Magician may go on for a long time being fooled and flattered by the Astrals that he has himself modified or manufactured. Their natural subservience to himself will please him, poor ape!

"They will pretend to show him marvellous mysteries, pageants of beauty and wonder unspeakably splendid; he will incline to accept them as true, for the very reason that they are images of himself idealized by the imagination.

"But his real progress will stop dead. These phantasms will prevent him from coming into contact with independent intelligences, from whom alone he can learn anything new.

"He will become increasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to be attaining one initiation after another. His Ego will expand unchecked, till he seem to himself to have heaven at his feet. Yet all this will be nothing but his fool's face of Narcissus smirking up from the pool that will drown him." [(via)](http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/app3.html)

In many ways, *The Vision and the Voice* marks the high point of Crowley's career as an Adept—now a Magister Templi—of the Golden Dawn system outlined by his mentor Mathers. Post-Algeria, Crowley would be wrapped up in the drama of a new mystery school—the Ordo Templi Orientis or OTO—and concern himself largely with its sexual methods and with instituting Thelema as a religion, with himself as the head. His research progressed along other lines, and administrative manners; however, Crowley the Pure Seeker was never quite so pristine, to be replaced with Crowley the PR Man for the Aeon.

Additionally, Crowley used a Muslim mantra, from Surah 112, while travelling across the desert—this being done to enter receptive mental states, or "purify" himself as he put it, by creating states of absolute physical exhaustion so that his body would not disturb his mind, much like the use of *asana* in Hatha Yoga:

*Qul: Huw-Allahu ahad; Allahu samad; lam yalid wa lam yulad; wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad.* 

This was recited 1,001 times per day, with each recitation followed by a prostration. (1,001 is obviously taken from *1,001 Nights*, translated by Crowley's early hero and role model Richard Burton; it is used in this book to denote an infinitely large number, much as the number 10,000 is used in Buddhist texts. The number is indeed important in Sufism; students of the [Mevlevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevlevi_Order) dervish order must undergo 1,001 days of prayer before becoming a teacher.)

Crowley was now able to penetrate beyond the initial two aethyrs; his progress beyond the 19th was assisted by a specially appointed Angelic guardian; the following aethyrs concerned the equilibriation and then destruction of Crowley's individual self. By the 14th Aethyr, Crowley and Neuberg has climbed the mountain Daleh Addin—this mountain is now called Djebel Chélia or simply Chélia; it was here that Crowley began to have Victor Neuberg sodomize him, as an effort in taboo-breaking and disruption of the personality—Crowley writes (circuitiously, as sodomy was still illegal, a major reason for Crowley's often obfuscatory writing and personal legal troubles) that "I may say that the essence of the matter was that I had hitherto clung to certain conceptions of conduct which, while perfectly proper from the standpoint of my human nature, were impertinent to initiation." This may have assisted visionary states; it may also have been a deep working out of Crowley's own conflict around his sexuality. While homosexuality was not new for him, passive sodomy may have been. This sexual taboo-breaking also occurs in Madimi's request that Dee and Kelley swap wives, perhaps as a way of deeply disrupting the personality in order to open it to further visionary input. As Dee and Kelley eventually did, Crowley writes that he "obeyed my Angel," and turned passive sodomy [was it actually this?] into a means of invoking his Holy Guardian Angel. He would later write in the comfort of his own intellect and literary anonymity in the *Bagh-i-Muattar*, where he becomes much more confident and bombastic. Crowley glyphed this act in later writings as "XIº OTO"—homosexual sex magick—although at the time he had not yet been initiated to OTO.

![Djebel Chelia](http://www.vitaminedz.com/photos/27/27067-djebel-chelia-aures.jpg "Djebel Chélia")
<center><sub>Djebel Chélia as it appears today.</sub></center>

These acts, he wrote, disrupted his personality and undermined his ego totally—he was in a state of psychosis or mania, perhaps. Crowley was now to enter the "City of Pyramids," a landscape informed by the Enochian tablets or rather the Golden Dawn conceit of turning their squares into pyramids, this being the habitation of Masters or non-physical adepts, and given to the task of the Master of the Temple in raising up humanity, in Crowley's case under the planetary aegis of Jupiter or the sphere Chesed. The Queen of the City of Pyramids was now revealed to be BABALON herself, who accepted the blood of the saints here encamped, and to whom they were enjoined to offer their ego totally, under penalty of imperfect initiation and stagnation; similary to Dee and Kelley's account of the "Daughter of Fortitude," BABALON's appearance followed the successful accomplishment of the breaking of sexual taboo.

Now being "abandoned" by his angelic guardian, Crowley was told to call the 10th Aethyr, ZAX, and cross the "Abyss" or separation between God and man, noumenon and phenomenon, the guardian of which was CHORONZON, the "mighty devil" [c] described by Kelley. Crowley was here taking the name "Coronzon" from Casaubon and changing the spelling to Choronzon, potentially so that were the name transliterated into Hebrew, the first letter would be Cheth, "Ch." Crowley's Hebrew transliteration, given in *Sepher Sephiroth*, is ChVRVNZVN, Cheth-Vau-Resh-Vau-Nun-Zayin-Vau-Nun, enumerating to 333 by Gematria. By Greek gematria, 333 also enumerates to the words for "incontinence, dispersion, debauchery and wantonness"—in Hebrewm it also enumerates to AYQ BKR, the Qabalah of the nine chambers, and ShLG, snow (Eshelman adds HChShN, the darknessm and HShChVTCh, the slaughtered). All of this suggests the dispersion of the mind or, as Eshelman puts it, the "Anti-Will."

However, this spelling is one of several things that Casaubon got wrong; Dee's diaries themselves identify this entity as "Coronzom," and this has been corrected in Stephen Skinner's revision of Casaubon. In Enochian letters, this would be:

<center><h2><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">CORONZOM</p></h2></center>

[**NOTE:** This Enochian web font, designed in 1996, is inaccurate. It uses the same character (Don) for Don (R) and Tal (M), a common beginner mistake; they are different characters. See the Enochian alphabet below. This means the final Tal or M is not correct, this would unfortunately have to be done by hand. Then again, maybe it's best not to put a demon's name online.]

<center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Enochian_alphabet.png/550px-Enochian_alphabet.png"></center>

From Dee's diaries (quoted from Eshelman, not Skinner):

*But Coronzon[sic] (for so is the name of that mighty devil), envying man's felicity, and perceiving that the substance of man's lesser part was frail and unperfect in respect to his purer essence, began to assail man, and so prevailed.*

This demon—representing the final chaos of the mind or the reason/discursive ego itself incorrectly attempting to usurp the throne of God or pure, trans-linguistic, transpersonal spiritual intuition ("knowledge is a false crown [i.e. is not Kether though may appear to be to one who has not overcome their ego]")—was evoked into a triangle using the medium of pigeon blood (three pigeons were sacrificed), in operating procedures taken from the *Göetia* or *Lesser Key of Solomon*—Kelley had been rebuked by the Angels for his prior work with Göetia. Neuberg worked as the operator while Crowley himself stood in the triangle, perhaps hoping Neuberg would "exorcise" the Choronzom complex from him totally. Crowley was possessed, broke the circle and attacked Neuberg; Neuberg banished the demon back to the triangle by vibrating the Qabalistic names of God and striking Crowley with his magical dagger. The demon returned to the triangle where it continued to psychologically attack Neuberg until the "energy" in the spilled pigeon blood was depleted. Crowley wrote the name of BABALON in the sand with his ring, and emerged from his possession trance. The ordeal lasted two hours.

Beyond ZAX, the character of the Aethyrs changed. Crowley notes that the original text of the 19th Call reads, at face value, as curse:

"O YE Heavens which dwell in the first Air, yea are mighty in the parts of the Earth, and execute the Judgment of the Highest! Unto you it is said: Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth, and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding to dispose all things according to the Providence of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, and rose up in the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be governed by her parts, and let there be Division in her, that the glory of her may be always drunken, and vexed in itself. Her course, let it run with the Heavens; and as an handmaid let her serve them. One season, let it confound another, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her members, let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one Creature equal with another. The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them forget their Names. The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His buildings, let them become Caves for the beasts of the Field! Confound her understanding with darkness! For why? it repenteth me that I have made Man. One while let her be known, and another while a stranger: because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that is fallen."

In the 9th Aethyr and beyond, and Coronzom overcome, the text appeared to Crowley as a blessing, showing that is only the mind of man which projects evil and disorder upon the pristine perfection of the Universe and, that mind being overcome, there was now nothing but perfection to see. [Elizabethan conception of chaos.] Without an ego, there was now nothing to suffer, and nothing to make suffer. It was years, however, before Crowley could fully assimilate this perspective. As anybody who has tasted heaven through spirtual practice or drugs can tell you, there's always a comedown, and always a morning after. But once you've seen freedom, you can't forget that it exists, and you can begin the work of slowly retraining a lifetime of bad thinking and false perception—*samskaras*, as Hindu meditators would say—to fall in line with the new perspective.

The remaining Aethyrs showed progressive visions of purity and grace, until the sequence ended. (My own experiences with the 30 Aethyrs, repeated in haphazard fashion in 2006 with a group of 7 individuals, can be found in *Ultraculture Journal.*)

##Relation of Crowley/Neuberg's work to Dee/Kelley's

Outside of Crowley's claims that he was the reincarnation of Kelley, the visions related in Bou Saada elucidate an immense amount of material from the Western Esoteric Tradition, combining imagery from the books of Genesis, Exodus, Daniel, Maccabees, Revelation, the Gospels and others; the various Mediterranean mystery cults; Islam; Dee & Kelly's work; Solomonic magick; Freemasonry; Rosicrucianism and, in particular, the initiation rituals and formulae of the Golden Dawn as well as the Book of the Law and Crowley's other channeled Holy Books. They form a "grand overview" of over 2,000 years of Western religious history, elegantly and precisely summarized into 30 concise visions that suggest high-degree Masonic initiations via mystery play, as in the Scottish Rite. 

The following artifacts from Dee and Kelly's work explicity appear in *The Vision and the Voice*, where their meanings are elaborated beyond what was given in the *Spirit Diaries*:

- The 30 Aethyrs themselves
- The Enochian language
- The Holy Table
- The 7 names of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, formed into a magic square
- BABALON
- The angel Madimi (Aethyr 17)

##Astrological Factors

Though not calculated or timed by Crowley and Neuberg, James Eshelman later worked to analyze the astrology of each Aethyr calling itself as an attempt to isolate astrological influences on the visions from the actual content of the Aethyrs themselves. This is outside our scope for the present work but will be mentioned when appropriate here. Eshelman notes that the sun was in sidereal Scorpio (tropical Sagittarius) between the 28th and 5th Aethyrs, highly relevant to the sexual/destructive qualities of BABALON. 

##Summary of Method

Here, then, is a summary of the methods used by O.M. and Omnia Vincam:

1. Sensory deprivation and social isolation by remaining in uninhabited desert conditions.
2. Physical exhaustion from crossing desert while making 1,001 prostrations per day.
3. Mental focus and emptiness by making 1,001 recitations of Surah 112 per day.
4. The recitation of the 19th Call, modified for each Aethyr.
5. Physically scrying into a golden topaz, while overshadowed by the Aethyr.
6. Taboo-breaking by homosexual sex magick (passive sodomy).
7. Göetic-style evocation AND invocation with aid of animal sacrifice for material basis.

Methods 1-3 would have formed a powerful separation from anything but the ritual psychotheater generated by methods 4-7; such devices are well known by cults the world over as ways of isolating individuals and removing them from anything but the world view of the cult. While here the cult consisted of only two individuals and the methods self-applied, the techniques are consistent. Within such conditions, and within a shared private universe, Crowley and Neuberg—like Dee and Kelley before them—were able to enter a kind of "virtual reality" generated by their unfettered minds, emerging with one of the most striking literary and religious works, in my opinion, of the 20th century. The prose of *The Vision and the Voice* is the best of Crowley's career, surpassing even the Holy Books; like Kelley's messages from the Angels, it is at once exquisitely sacred and profoundly chilling. Next to Dee and Kelley's own Spirit Diaries, it is the primary document of Enochian magick in practice—while Dee and Kelley received the system, Crowley and Neuberg actually *used* it—or at least used a section of it, namely the 30 Aethyrs, rather than the Holy Table itself (Crowley would use the Tablets in later workings, particularly in combination with the VIIIº OTO or masturbatory sex magick). For this reason, *The Vision and the Voice*, or *Liber 418* as it is technically designated in Crowley's A∴A∴, should be studied alongside Dee and Kelley's work.

Following are analyses of each Aethyr. 

##Sources and Publication History

I will here be referring to the following texts:

Crowley, Aleister, with Victor B. Neuberg and Mary Desti. *The Vision & The Voice, With Commentary and Other Papers. (The Equinox, Vol. IV, No. II).* York Beach: Weiser, 1998.

Eshelman, James A. *Visions & Voices: Aleister Crowley's Enochian Visions With Astrological & Qabalistic Commentary.* Los Angeles: The College of Thelema, 2011.

*The Vision & The Voice* was originally published, uncommented, as the special supplement to *The Equinox*, Vol. I, No. V, 1911. Two sets of commentary were later added by Crowley, which were published in a 1952 edition of *V&V* by Karl Germer, which was again revised by Israel Regardie in 1972, who mixed his own notes in with Crowley's without distinction. The final version was William Breeze's, used here and noted above. The very original text was handwritten by Victor Neuberg in Algeria.

Crystal cube in form of Harpocrates (Malkuth) surrounded by sphere (Aethyrs)—"I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. 'Come unto me' is a foolish word: for it is I that go'"—surrounded by four archangels. Suggests Pentagram ritual. Harpocrates is the center of the 4 archangels—"(This is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein am I as a babe in an egg.)"

New Aeon comes in at Four Quarters, in each of which an Archangel holds a book labelled back and front in Enochian. [Note: The M's are fucked in the font.] The Archangels are in black robes, their wings and armor lined out in white. All this symbolism seems to elaborate the Pentagram Ritual. Tetragrammaton imagery is found throughout.

Crowley, from *Book 4*:

*The formation of the "Yod" is the formulation of the first creative force, of that father who is called "self-begotten", and unto whom it is said: "Thou has formulated thy Father, and made fertile thy Mother". The adding of the "He" to the "Yod" is the marriage of that Father to the great co-equal Mother, who is a reflection of Nuit as He is of Hadit. Their union brings forth the son "Vau" who is the heir. Finally the daughter "He" is produced. She is both the twin sister and the daughter of "Vau". His mission is to redeem her by making her his bride; the result of this is to set her upon the throne of her mother, and it is only she whose youthful embrace can reawaken the eld of the All-Father. In this complex family relationship is symbolised the whole course of the Universe. It will be seen that (after all) the Climax is at the end. It is the second half of the formula which symbolises the Great Work which we are pledged to accomplish. The first step of this is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, which constitutes the Adept of the Inner Order. The re-entry of these twin spouses into the womb of the mother is that initiation described in Liber 418, which gives admission to the Inmost Order of the A∴ A∴ Of the last step we cannot speak.*

Breaking the Maidenhead of Nuit—Uniting of Heh and Vau. That Heh final might partake. From the Golden Dawn 4=7 ritual, the explanation of the Diagram at the Altar:

*This is the symbolic re resentation of THE FALL. For, the Great Goddess who, in the 3=8 Grade was supporting the
Columns of the Sephiroth, in the sign of the 2=9 Grade, being tempted by the Tree of Knowledge (whose branches indeed tend
upward into the Seven Lower Sephiroth, but also tend downward anto the Kingdom of Shells) reached down unto the Qlippoth,
and immediately the Columns were unsupported and the Sephirotic system was shattered, and with it fell ADAM, the MICROPROSOPUS.*

*Then arose the Great DRAGON with Seven Heads and Ten Horns, and the Garden was made desolate, and MALKUTH was cut off from the Sephiroth by his intersecting folds, and linked unto the Kingdom of Shells. And the Seven Lower Sephiroth were cut off
from the Three Supernals in DAATH, at the feet of AIMA ELOHIM.*

*And on the Heads of the Dragon are the Names and Crowns of the Edomite Kings. And because in DAATH was the greatest rise of the Great Serpent of Evil, therefore is there, as it were, another Sephirah, making for the Infernal or Averse Sephiroth, Eleven instead of Ten.*

*And hence were the Rivers of Eden desecrated, and from the Mouth of the DRAGON rushed the Infernal Waters in DAATH. And this is LEVIATHAN, The Crooked Serpent.*

*But between the Devastated Garden and the Supernal Eden, YOD HE VAU HE ELOHIM placed the Letters of THE NAME and THE
FLASHING SWORD that the uppermost part of the Tree of Life might not be involved in the Fall of Adam. And thence it was
necessary that the SECOND ADAM should come to restore all things and that,as the First Adam had been extended on the Cross of
the Celestial Rivers, so the SON should be crucified on the Cross of the Infernal Rivers of DAATH. Yet, to do this, he must descend unto the lowest first, even unto Malkuth and be born of her.*

Green sky covered with gold stars, dark (Venus/Solar). The imagery is the four beasts of Daniel and Apocalypse, surrounding the throne of the Elders (seen in Aethyr 30), as in ATU XXI and ATU X Rider-Waite. Also the Kerubs of the Elements, following on from the Pentagram Ritual symbolism in Aethyr 30 (Kerubs are seen in Supreme Pentagram Ritual of GD).

Scorpio-Taurus: East-West. Leo-Aquarius: South-North. As if Antares, Regulus and Aldebaran were rising, culminating and setting. Scorpio-Taurus=Nun Vav, NU; + Leo=Teth, NUT, Nuit.

**East:** Eagle-angel/Scorpio/Water/Heh/Understanding, wings hide heaven (the immediate, scary future). Speech reminiscent of ATU XX in Rider-Waite. This is the GD attribution but years later Crowley would re-attribute the Eagle to Air instead of Water, leaving Scorpio.

Chesed absorbed in the Abyss.

**South:** Lion/Leo/Fire/Yod/Wisdom, wounded and perplexed, the Beast 666, Sol in Strength. Wounded masculine of Aeon of Osiris—dying patriarchy?

**West:** Bull/Taurus/Earth/Heh final, white with horns of white and black and gold, scarlet mouth, sapphire eyes, cleaving sky with sword (air, as Taurus itself is attributed to air), lightning and deep clouds of Indigo. Again the YHVH symbolism. The fall of Christianity/Osiris/Mithras. Work of Yesod/2=9 A.A.

**North:** Man/Libra [instead of Aquarius]/Saturn on Great horse with scourge and balances (Libra/Lamed/Justice), black velvet - similar to Death of Apocalypse (Kalki) (Note: Death/Kalki, as is Horus, is "crowned and conquering" in Revelation). Gaze into unconscious to see superconsciousness.

Air as herald of Aquarius/Current of destiny in the body of Nuit. Everything is changed, and it only looks like chaos (CHAOS = Chokmah and a name of the Beast, see Biroco Kaos 14) but it is the skeleton of a new truth. Light consumed in womb of Binah to create itself anew. LVX/INRI:IAO/TARO passwords (see The Wake World)—LVX cross hidden in cubical Swastika. 65, 231, 21, 78. 18º SR?

An invocation of Binah, of the wheel of Time, and foreshadowing of the Abyss/ZAX.

An angel (Hod/Aries) in a sapphire stone suggesting Tiphareth and Path Samekh, with eyes suggesting Binah (the Angel and the Abyss), warding Binah. The end of the illusion of Time. If you come here you must be scarred with sorrow (become 8=3). Unification of opposing sephira—Sun/Moon, Mars/Venus, Saturn/Jupiter. [The entire V&V is Crowley's initiation to Binah.]

The four Watch-Towers of the Elements are *within* Chesed/Jupiter as symbolized by Sapphire (four/Jupiter/stability of universe). Crossed arms of Osiris at Tiphareth before destruction as salt (8=3). 8=3 may make a new Qabalah, but intellectual manipulations are useless for crossing Abyss. 

Enochian writing:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">OLAHO VIRUDEN MAHORELA ZODIREDA! ON PIREDA EXENTASER; ARBA PIRE GAH GAHA GAHAL GAHALANA VO ABRA NA GAHA VELUCORSAPAX.</p></h3></center>

Which is suggested to be part lunar language. Laycock's translation for Regardie:

"For the second time I have beautified those dark Heavens I inhabit! builded there for the Holy Mother of all. The shrine of the spirits existed, exists, and shall exist, wherein it is provided that the Babe of the Abyss [is] enthroned."

Name of warden, by a cipher, is:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">LIXIPSL</p></h3></center>

Originally calculated as Draco Magnus or Mighty Dragon, Nuit/Binah. Breeze notes this should be 552, "Desiderium dierum," 
"Longing for the days." Eshelman gives 491 by Hebrew and 620 by Enochian; he suggests the angel was trolling him by making him dwell on exactly the kind of intellectual bs he had just warned against. Angel says that it is above the three angels of this Aethyr, but that there are four angels in the 30th Aethyr who have none above them (therefore breaking up into the dispersion of Coronzom).

"Face of mother is scarred by nails of devil" = Vau Vau Vau, 666? The number of mankind and also Sol, Tiphareth, below Binah. The seer descends to physically viewing his Rose Cross (rose cross imagery = his scrying equipment).

Core message of Aethyr BAG, which corresponds directly to 3=8 Practicus grade, is that truth comes from intuition, not intellect. The transcendence of the intellect (HOD) which is the primary task of the Practicus.

Passwords of all grades (55 + 45 + 36 + 28 + 21 + 15 + 10) = 210 = NOX, the Word of the Abyss.

522 = Vau-Vau-Mem = 21, mystery of ATU XVIII, exaltation of Venus in Pisces (seems doubtful).

Eshelman: Leo Taurus Taurus = 7+1+1 = 9, Yesod (Moon).

If the paths truly are attributed by Sephira/4 Worlds as Eshelman suggests, there seems to be a lot of reflecting of higher worlds into lower (similar to how grades mirror the lessons of their reversals, i.e. 3=8/8=3). 

Lunar and Venusian imagery (silver, huntress, etc—hence Hecate). Path Gimel (Hecate, Luna). Luna as the Sensorium, man's spiritual state in relation to perceived phenomena. This seems to track lunar/huntress imagery *across* the tree—Venus/Luna/Gimel/Sagittarius. Specifically: Gimel, Yesod, Qoph. This triple attribution of the moon = [Threefold Goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)) (Mother/Maiden/Crone, Hecate, the outer manifestation of BABALON/Binah, etc. Binah=3.) Imagery here subsumes all lunar. 

War of Aires and elements (I seem to remember that somebody somewhere actually took this to mean there was a war between angels of the Aethyrs and the ones of the Tablets; Crowley here suggests it to mean that coefficients of Circle and Square must be commensurable—squaring of circle, etc?) Eshelman: Tablets as interface between cubical material universe and Aethyrs. (Their letters form governors of Aethyrs; suggesting perhaps tablets as faces of cube projecting the Aethyrs OUTWARD like a holographic projection? War as Ruach vs Neshamah.)

Rainbow path of Qesheth, Rainbow of Promise, Archer's Bow of Sagittarius = Solar light of Tiphareth *reflecting on* the lunar waters of Yesod (therefore creating the Path blending of the two Sephira); those who walk the path successfully become *Hodos Chamelionis* in G.D.

Kamailos = camel/rope across abyss. Angel of Daleth/love of Supernals balancing Path Gimel (similar to Samekh balancing Peh). Calling to hounds in the Lunar Language.

This symbols appears in Adeptus Minor initiation of GD in center of floor of Vault of the Adepti and also on the head of the Pastos. It is a symbol of Venus and now BABALON—and, of course, there are 49 Calls in total, 49 days in the Bardo between death and reincarnation in Tibetan Buddhism, 49 Tables given to Dee and Kelley by the angels (see DeSalvo, *Decoding the Enochian Secrets*, making this a most crucial number. 49 is also HGYAL, the Intelligence of Venus, MT, the Rod of Aaron, and many more. And of course is 7 x 7 (see the Seal of Babalon).

Art card/Sagittarius (Cauldron). Hecate does not understand why BABALON needs the blood of the Adepts. Pearls = Masters of Temple secreted by Binah around specks of dust. Dragon as mask of Kephra in ATU XVIII. Black Dragon stage of alchemy (Portal ritual). Stone as code word for intimate union. Da'ath=Knowledge=Gnosis? (!) 

Echoes of Liber LXV and VII. Phenomenon of destruction of phenomenon for M.T.; kisses... The word of the Aeon is MAKHASHANAH (418, a blind for ABRAHADABRA). And to call Hecate (Yorke reconstruction)—an invocation of Shekinah to descend the Middle Pillar to Tav:

UOHULU ARPAZNA BINUF LA LA LA ARANA SOBANA FONUSA SAD NEDIEZO LO LAHARA EN NOM TUTULU MAHARNA OBOLO ARARNAY

TUTULU: VII 7:6: "We know why all is hidden in the stone, within the coffin, within the mighty sepulchre, and we too answer Olalám! Imál! Tutúlu! as it is written in the ancient book."

Unconnected imagery at beginning and end of visions: Ambient Yetziratic patterning due to astrological conditions (Eshelman's view).

48, Kokab, sphere of Mercury—or by a Breeze calculation, 31, the secret key of AL. Nuit/Hadit. The TWINS, Ra-Hoor-Khuit/Hoor-Par-Kraat, combined as Heru-Ra-Ha, the Lord of the Aeon. Replacement of the Judgement with the Stele, the Aeon (Judging the Judgers). Crowley on calculations around name—the name means "The Sacred Secret Key-letter of *The Book of the Law* of Thelema, appearing through the Operation of Mercury as well as giving a complete symbolical description of the Stele itself."

Eshelman: DES = 72, the Shem-ham-Mephorash (hence Goetia), and one way of signing the Four Worlds.

The focus here is the *illusory nature* of Tiphareth in relation to Binah. 

It will here be necessary to elaborate just *who the hell* Ankh-f-n-Khonsu is—not just another prior incarnation, we are asked to believe, of the Kelley/Cagliostro/Levi/Crowley entity, but a priest of the war-god Mentu (an analogue of Ra-Hoor-Khuit) during the final dynasty and cultural bloom of Egypt prior to its final conquest by Persia. The mythology is wrapped up with the transmission of the Book of the Law and discovered at the Cairo Museum. Or is AANK just another "spook" that is using Crowley, perhaps as an Egyptian sorceric method of reincarnation? (Crowley's followers recite identifactory, funerary hymns to AANK four times a day.)

Pentagram (destiny of man) in the blackness of heaven that is the blackness of an angel (solar blackness = NOX = opening of mankind to superconsciousness). Angel of destruction symbolizes Jupiter-Jehovah / Osiris-Jesus who are Chesed and Tiphareth and therefore **never extended beyond the abyss to the Supernals**—never even had an idea of them! Absolutely critical. These are tribal gods... they have deprived mankind of hearing and sight (vision and voice, spirit and fire). Hence the V&V.

12^3 = 1728 petals of fire, Zodiac brought to material plane (see Wake World on 13 times tables)=the powers of the name HUA as the Zodiac manifested in 3D form (Nuit?). [Aries/Emperor/Suplhur/Sun] A note suggesting that restriction of love to basic monogamous straight sex is a curse. More notes on formula of YHVH. Cult of Jehovah *cannot even reach Da'ath*. Jehovah is *not even the true Chesed, but the evil Dyad.* (i.e. Qliphoth of Chokmah? Chesed?) Jehovah was the evil Chesed in the Aeon of the True Chesed (Isis), his tyranny broken by the Solar Jesus; symbolized by a golden eagle breakiing out of a golden egg (but only a repeat of Old Aeon).

(Eagle=Jupiter, hence Jehovah, the Demiurge—also symbols of Tiphareth, Air, Sol.)

The Eagle-Headed God Jesus cries: "There is no sin, and there is no salvation." (See the more controversial utterances of the Angels to Dee and Kelley on the non-existence of sin.) Crowley states Jesus knows this truth, but if he says it nobody will care about him. He is an object of worship only for those in the OUTER world of Maya, not for adepts/Chasidim. He senses incoming of NOX. Light is an illusion, truth is an illusion—the great illusions beyond life/space/time. (Elements/Pentagram/Binah/Tree/LVX are all illusions.) Everything is backward... (reversal of consciousness of NOX—see *Liber 333*). Jesus as accursed child of elements, not their father. Calls to Binah and Chokmah to answer *his* prayer but as these spheres are exposing the futility of the intellect of which he is part it matters not. He is being dissolved by the progress of human consciousness. *Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine*: The Church shrinks from blood (Binah/BABALON/formula of 8=3). Anguish of humanity's loss of its ideal. [215 - zarach, "ato shine/rise as sun, to give light, sunrise," "East"]

45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!

46. Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen.

47. But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.

48. My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox, and none by the Book?

Jesus emerges from corruption of four elements and cries out for the supernal NOX. [Jehovah as Air-Kerub]

Commonality of repetition of "woe, woe, woe, woe" etc. in Enochian text. [Perhaps this = Sorrow, Binah, BABALON.] Woe in Enochian is OHIO:

<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">OHIO</p></h3></center>

The intellect itself, devoid of Supernal inspiration, is dragged forth and cursed. Jehovah as accursed duality. (The accursed Dyad.) Masonic-style curses on the four elements *in the order* that they fall into in the Elemental Tablets. [I.e. slaves shall serve: Worship the world of appearances/Maya and be fucked by it.] Demiurge equated with Ego.

Bright black = Akasha (black/indigo egg—primordial space itself)

Literal pure-night-blue when the Thelemic gods are invoked? 

Blood driven down by gods: Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Stele, and below is Seb/Geb, into whom is concentrated the clotted blood—Earth has absorbed the Carnage of the ruin wrought by Jesus and will grow a new life through putrefectation—the basic formula, not High Magick. The Christian era is fertilizer for the New Aeon. Fun fun for servants of star and snake...

Eshelman: Enochian enumerates to 25, 5x5 (Geburah), YHVD (Briatic Name of Geburah), ChIVA (Beast- Shiva as Pashupatinath?). Not mentioned by JAE is that 25=the Pentagram, and of course V.V.V.V.V., the head of A.A. and Crowley's motto as Magister Templi, who is here identified with the Beast and has "10 horns that spring from 5 points" and 8 heads.

Crowley identifies the Beast with both Leo AND Caput Draconis and occasionally confuses them in his handwritten notes.

Caput Draconis is head of lion-serpent/Beast 666 (see Enochian Alphabet) [sperm as blood of new Aeon], born of Set/Pan and woman clothed with sun—see Casaubon and Revelation [is the woman clothed with the sun BABALON?] Rev 12:1 "A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head." Atus of Lust + The Aeon give key of New Aeon. (XI+XX=XXXI, Achad's Key.) Stone of Gemini/twins (RHK/HPK). An angel bearing a pitcher/amphora (cup/ATU XVII?) that is Avatar of Babalon. Angel consolidatess paths going downward to Tiphereth from Supernals—Gimel (intersecting Teth—Moon/Sun, high tantric, AL:I he sun/she moon etc), Zayin and Heh.

Accompanied by angels of Death (Samekh) (Kalki) and Jehovah/Jesus (A'ayin)—these are swallowed up by the lion Beast 666. This lion's mouth is closed by Babalon (Strength). Arrayed with angels with silver spears (Crowley says in later commentary to Liber LXV that angels with spears, weaponry, trumpets, lightning, etc are positive symbols/of HGA rather than the decay and dispersion attendant upon evil genius). Stars burnt up in nostrils (Pranayama). Paraphrase of Bornless One—let all these spirits be as motes dancing in a beam of my eye. 

Teth actually means "a coiling, twisting" according to Karl Feyerabend (not Paul)=i.e. Kundalini, which also literally means "coiled" (not snake) in Sanskrit—by *Sepher Yetzirah*, Teth, is "the consciousness of the secret of all spiritual activities." Devouring of everything by *shushumna* channel (hence kundalini imagery and Babalon as Sakti). Blasting trumpets = nadi sounds, see Hatha Yoga Pradpika, as well as ATU XX in old deck (Israfel).

The word Gimel (GML) is a formula for advance of the Adeptus Minor—the goal in reflection in lower grades? (Similar to cleaving to Samekh while in Hod/Netzach?) GML, Gimel spelt in full = Paths Gimel, Mem, Lamed (see tree). Hod>Geburah>Tiphareth>Kether.

Swallowing Scorpio and Netzach (wouldn't that be Tiphareth? Yes, Lion is a solar/Tiphareth symbol). Also slain Capricornus and drunk up sea (Cap/Hod). [So lion in Tiphareth crowns the Man's attainment—Crowley's various early notes on all symbols of Adonai being subsumed into that of a Lion, the Beast 666—but it is silenced/ridden by Babalon in Teth.] 419 rays in crown, snake body, [<-- Leo imagery] soul of Crowned Child. 419-418=1; 667[Scarlet Woman]-666=1. 

419=TITh, Teth in full; 418 = ChITh, Beast +1=419

"In his hand is a spear that is a cup of fornication" = IXº OTO (kept secret here). On mouth is seal of 156. Secret of vvvvv—VVVVV has 10 horns that spring from 5 points (= **The Pentagram, VVVVV**) and 8 [Cheth, same spelling as ChITh, beast.] heads.

COMMENTARY (ΜΘ)

49 is the square of 7.

7 is the passive and feminine number.

The chapter should be read in connection with Chapter 31 for IT now reappears.

The chapter heading, the Waratah, is a voluptuous scarlet flower, common in Australia, and this connects the chapter with Chapters 28 and 29; but this is only an allusion, for the subject of the chapter is OUR LADY BABALON, who is conceived as the feminine counterpart of IT.

This does not agree very well with the common or orthodox theogony of Chapter 11; but it is to be explained by the dithyrambic nature of the chapter.

In paragraph 3 NO MAN is of course NEMO, the Master of the Temple, Liber 418 will explain most of the allusions in this chapter.

In paragraphs 5 and 6 the author frankly identifies himself with the BEAST referred to in the book, and in the Apocalypse, and in LIBER LEGIS. In paragraph 6 the word “angel” may refer to his mission, and the word “lion-serpent” to the sigil of his ascending decan. (Teth = Snake = spermatozoon and Leo in the Zodiac, which like Teth itself has the snake-form. θ first written ☉ = Lingam-Yoni and Sol.)

Paragraph 7 explains the theological difficulty referred to above. There is only one symbol, but this symbol has many names: of those names BABALON is the holiest. It is the name referred to in Liber Legis, 1, 22.

It will be noticed that the figure, or sigil, of BABALON is a seal upon a ring, and this ring is upon the forefinger of IT. This identifies further the symbol with itself.

It will be noticed that this seal, except for the absence of a border, is the official seal of the A∴A∴ Compare Chapter 3.

It is also said to be the seal upon the tombs of them that she hath slain, that is, of the Masters of the Temple.

In connection with the number 49, see Liber 418, the 22nd Aethyr, as well as the usual authorities.

Beast is charioteer (Cheth) of West, bearer of Sangraal. Heru-Ra-Ha as martial aspect of Sol (5=6/6=5), warrior lord of sun: "There is a splendour in my name hidden and glorious, as the sun of midnight is ever the son." Yet in him is woman that devoureth with her water all the fire of God [IXº OTO].

"Hell" as inmost part of man that consumes all experiences and thereby understands its own perfection (Formula of Babalon, queen of hell). 32 teeth, tongue as firey logos, four rivers of Eden that flow from Da'ath, see Aethyr 30 = fourfold understanding of logos (in four worlds). Blasphemed by TAOTZEM (taking material for spiritual sun—note for Resh). Name not to know in case pronounce and pass by (alphabet of passing the river?) Crowley weighed with sin of world. Foreshadow 9=2 initiation. 

Creature of earth and ye would have me swim = Assiah transfer to Yetzirah. Lion passes over Aethyr with crowned beast (VVVVV) on his back. In his tail are cities, planets etc. Tuft is a new universe. A foreshadowing of the Aeon of Thmaist, the Double-Wanded One (Greek form of Ma'at)—Lamed, proceeding away from Tiphareth to Geburah.

"And the voice said..." descriptive of 6=5 grade.

The Voice of the Beast 666 is here just a tremendous roaring (martial), which is also articulate.

*25. But there are excavations of excavations. (The excavation is the receptacle, like that which is hollowed out, or carved out, like a cave, or any other receptacle. Therefore all receptacles are inferior with respect to the superiors, among which the "shells" hold the last place, which here are described, which are) under the form of a vast serpent extending this way and that. (Concerning this serpent the author of the "Royal Valley" speaks thus in his "Treatise of the Shells." The fragments of the receptacles, which have fallen into the world of Creation, of Formation, and of Action, therein exist from the Outer; and judgments are more consonant to these, which are called profane, and have their habitation in the middle space between the Holy and the Unclean. And from the head is formed that great dragon which is in the sea, and is the sea-serpent, which is, however, not so harmful as the earthly one. And this dragon hath been castrated since his crest (or membrum genitale), together with his mate, have been repressed, and thence have been formed four hundred desirable worlds. And this dragon hath in his head a nostril (after the manner of whales) in order that he may receive influence, and in himself he containeth all other dragons, concerning which it is said: "Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons upon the waters" (Ps. lxxiv. 13). And here the idea or universal form of all the shells is understood, which encompasseth the seven inferior emanations of the queen after the manner of a serpent, as well from the right as from the left and from every side.)*

*[The excavation or receptacle of a Sephira is that quality whereby it receives the supernal influence from that which immediately precedes it; hence each Sephira has a double quality of receiving and of transmitting, which passes through the four worlds in each which the Sephiroth exist, though in gradually decreasing light. (See Table subjoined.) The "shells," Qlipoth, are the demons, in whom again is a form of the Sephiroth, distorted and averse. This great dragon which is here described is evidently identical with the leviathan of Job. He is the executor of judgment, the centripetal force, the old serpent ever seeking to penetrate into Paradise; finally, in a more exoteric sense he is Satan and the devil, the accusing one. In the Sepher Yetzirah, a most important qabalistical book, he is called Theli, ThLI, the dragon. Now, by Gematria. ThLI = 400 + 30 + 10 = 440; and if we "repress his crest"--i.e., take away the first letter, which is Th, Tau,--400, there will remain LI = 40 = M, Mem, the water. The "400 desirable worlds" are the numerical value of Th, and signify the power of the Tetragrammaton on the material plane (See note to section 21, foregoing). There is much alchemical symbolism contained in the "Siphra Dtzenioutha." The "Seven Inferior Emanations" of the queen, are the seven lower Sephiroth --viz., Chesed, Geburah, Tiphereth, Netzach, Hod. Yesod, and Malkuth; or Microprosopus and his bride, the king and queen. Shells," Qliphoth, are the evil spirits.]*

*26. His tail is in his head (that is, he holdeth his tail in his mouth, in order that he may form a circle, since he is said to encompass holiness). He transferreth his head to behind the shoulders (that is, he raiseth his head at the back of the bride of Microprosopus, where is the place of most severe judgments), and he is despised (since in him is the extremity of judgments and severities, whence wrath is the attribute of his forms). He watcheth (that is, he accurately searcheth out and seeketh in what place he may gain an entry into holiness. And he is concealed (as if laying traps; since he insinuateth himself into the inferiors, by whose sins he hath access to the holy grades, where the carrying out of judgments is committed to him.) He is manifested in one of the thousand shorter days. (Numbers are called days, and numbers of the inferior world short days; among which tens are attributed to the factive, on account of their decimal numeration; hundreds to the formative, since they are numbers of the light of their author, and draw their existence from the tens; but thousands to the creative, for the same reason. But that dragon hath about this his. most powerful location, whence, if a defect occurreth only in one numeration of that system through the fault of the inferiors, he is immediately manifest, and thus commenceth his accusations before the throne of glory.)*

*[Here is the origin of the well-known symbol of a serpent holding his tail in his mouth, like a circle--the serpent of Saturn. The reason that he raiseth his head behind the shoulders of the bride (Malkuth) is because he is. so to speak, not only the executor of judgment, but also the destroyer; destruction as opposed to creation, death as opposed to life. For the whole Sephiroth are represented as being the balance of mercy and justice, and the tenth Sephira is especially of the nature of justice, as also is Geburah. the fifth. He is concealed, because he is not called into action till justice requires him. The term "decimal numeration" of course refers to the ten Sephiroth. The presence of the serpent when revealed, is an accusation, because it shows that the balance is destroyed; just as in a watch, if one of the wheels be injured, irregularity is at once manifested. Now, life, when it consists of birth into another form, necessarily implies death in the previous form. The throne of glory is the Briatic world.]*

*27. There are swellings in his scales (that is, like as in a crocodile; because great in him is the heaping together of judgments). His crest keepeth its own place (that is, there is in him no further power of hastening to things beyond in the Outer).* 

*[There is in the destroyer no "hastening to the outer," because he is centripetal and not centrifugal.]*

*28. But his head is broken by the waters of the great sea. (The great sea is wisdom, the fountain of mercy and loving-kindness; which, if it sendeth down its influence, judgments are pacified, and the hurtful power of the shells is restricted); like as it is written, Ps. lxxiv. 13: "Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons by the waters."*

*["The waters of the great sea," are the influence of the supernal mother, Binah, of whom Malkuth is the reflection. But Binah receives the influence of Chokmah. See Introduction.]*

*29. They were two (male and female, whence the text of the Psalm speaketh of the dragons in the plural number; but when the plural number is given in its least form, two only are understood). They are reduced into one (for the female leviathan hath been slain, lest they should seek to multiply judgments). Whence the word ThNINM, Thenanim (in the before-mentioned passage of the Psalm), is written in a defective form (purposely to denote that restriction).*

*[I may refer the reader to the Talmud for further information regarding Jewish ideas of the Leviathan. Thenanim is written in a defective form, because the letter I of the plural is omitted. Written fully, it should be ThNINIM, instead of ThNINM.]*

*30. (But it is said) heads (in the plural number, for the purpose of denoting a vast multitude, as well of species as of individuals in that genus); like as it is written, Ezek. i. 22: "And a likeness as a firmament above the heads of the living creature." (Where also the word living creature, ChIH, Chiah, is put in the singular as a genus of angels; and heads in the plural for the purpose of denoting species and innumerable individuals.)*

*["Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons (Thenanim) by the waters." It must be remembered that this dragon is said by the author of the "Royal Valley" to be the king of all the "shells" or demons. Now, the demons are divided into ten classes. corresponding to the ten Sephiroth, but in an averse form, and are called in the book, "Beth Elohim," the "impure Sephiroth." The heads of the leviathan (cf. the Lernæan Hydra which Hercules slew) are probably these. Compare the description of the beast in Revelation.]*

Comment: Here is the First Key to the formula of Horus, a sevenfold arrangement. A shadow of Horus declares his nature.

LIN=ChSN, ruler of Air, Strength. 118 = 2 x 59, Brethren. Twins concealed in HeruRH. Lilith/Samael. First formula of Horus is that of Babalon, as He is yet within HER womb. [Note 10th Aire, PARAOAN-I’m not there yet]

[esh: Mercurial symbolism. Also solar symbolism—high/deeper version of the 5=6 GD initiation. Note outer/inner initiations. LIN= 9, Tzaddi, “Sun of the Morning, Chief Among the Mighty” (see line 21 of aethyr, Harpocrates on lotus), emerging kingship. LIN = Paths of Cheth, Samekh, Nun: Openings to Binah, Tiphareth and then Tiphareth with reference to Binah {50 Gates}]

Into the stone: The table of 49 squares. (Chanokh: SAAIME/SBHDIII table—this is presumably the 7 names of Sigillum Dei Aemeth i.e. Babalon, arranged into a magical square—or this square likely predated the Sigillum? See Skinner.). {7 planetary angels are drawn from this table.} Surrounded by angels [Gods down to elementals]. Each letter composed of 49 other letters, in a language similar to that of Honorius/Theban [See Agrippa—~1531, pre-Dee and Dee influential]. (!!) But cannot be read. Now comes PAN as an angel uniting 7 planets [9th Aethyr] [many colors, but = Chokmah; as gray of chokmah = all colors. Also Samekh = rainbow]. Aire beocmes light and drips dew [Supernal Lion-Serpent in Menstruum of Liquid Pearl {Gimel?}] [JAE starts calling this a “quasi-physical” kundalini phenomenon here are starts babbling about John Denver wtf. Mentioned in GD 4=7?]. Dew = enormous globs, shining like moon, perfectly transparent and luminous.  [falling yods. Gen 27:38]

49 letters of tablet = 49 kinds of cosmos in every thought of God. 49 interpretations of every cosmos, every interpretation manifested 49 ways. So 49 calls, to each of which there are 49 visions. [Bowie when I’m typing: “Must have been touching close to 94.”] And each visions = 49 elements, except 10th, which is accursed, and has 42. [Doug Adams??] [42=Demiurge in Gen I, assessors in hall of dead, AMA Sterile Mother, Terror and Destruction, Loss, Earth of Malkuth. 10th Aethyr etc.] 

[Genesis I as Demiurge “evilly” creating imperfection from perfection.]

Solar Child develops from the Dew. 

Standing in form of Kneph, 0^0 omniform zero, winged egg from which all positive manifestation comes.

Looking into liquid surface of egg, all names of God, even not known to angels, crowd about.

7 senses -> 1 sense, then dissolved into itself in samadhi [sagittarius?]. Declare it all [all sag?] No link to Perdurabo. In samadhi behind veil of Table —Table as “Veil of Infinite”. Arms in form of cross, extending into infinity, with himself as point within it (Nuit/Hadit)—this is the birth of form. 

Encircled by immense sphere of many-colored bands, sphere of Sephiroth projected in the three dimensions—the birth of death. [Saturn?] [Death as self extended into negative circle/sphere of Nuit instead of positive balanced cross] [JL: This is an excellent summary of NOX formula vs LVX formula. One simply sees BEYOND the limits of the Cross of manifestation into infinity and then emptiness, i.e. Via Negativa, NOX.]

In center within is glowing sun—the birth of hell, the secret center of self [Liber Aleph]. “One perceives one’s Star as one’s True Self.” (!?!?! whoa dude. Also… VIIº OTO? Star as solar-phallic? WHOA DUDE)

Hell = same root as all covered/concealed stuff [JAE] Crucifixtion as Nuit/Hadit/Heru-Ra-Ha.

It is the virtue of the table to sweep everything away. 

Aethyr:
	I: Vision = Sag, Rainbow as 7fold projection
	L: Purity = Luna decreasing in Cancer. Active Luna always purifies, passive evil [active reflects sun not phantoms of night]. 
	N: Energy = Mars in Scorpio, energy which forms vision (in Taurus would cause action)

Mental analysis causes author to break into dispersion (333). Mental nature of aethyr… letters of Table are all wrong, shadows of shadows. Whoso beholdeth table is light=ARARITA, transmuted = ATh RAIAR, yod girt by suns tending inwardly upon it. RAIAR = Mercury by way of Bet. Kether and Sol are not light, as light is a duplex vibration energized by them and is thereby of their Messenger, Mercury (!!)

Voice of Aethyr is ceaseless thundering of word AUMGN, outside time. Amen continuous. Eye, Ayin, glory so great it cannot be manifested by any positive means (yes… intuitively perceiving this while reading, outside reason).

Table recedes - two angels above him with black wings - and he is shut up into Pastos of Christian Rosenkreutz (7 SIDES = PENTACLE OF BABALON = 49-FOLD TABLE - Demonstrating consistency of imagery through Dee>Rosicrucians>Golden Dawn even if reconstructed by Crowley in his mind/outside time?) Heru-Ra-Ha speaks from egg of blue. Flaming rosy cross before him. I have opened my eye and the universe dissolves. Upper eyelid force, lower eyelid matter, gazing into seven spaces (sephira) there is naught (emptiness). [JAE: This is HGA of Crowley]

[In GD init Crowley found his initiator in Pastos, here place are swapped.]

Horus slays Sobek, crowned with mixed forces of Aquarius, opposite in Zodiac to Leo (sign of Horus). 

Energy of Horus destroys *but must be withdrawn afterward* or he continues to vitalize with his energy (!!!!!!!!!!) (practical psychic defense). (Enterer/Silence - fucking drill it down.) The coherence of the broken matter must be withdrawn.

Harpo on lotus, fortress against water demon. gather yourselves unto me on lotus oh you sons of the morning (luciferians?) Horus chases Osiris into Ammenti and then follows him there so that his reign may be established even in the realms of death.  Death is now Life Triumphant in New Aeon, not by resurrection but by its own essence (?)

Thelemic afterlife: He is eternal and perceives himself the Universe by virtue of categories of Life and Death, which are not real, but subjective conditions of perception like time and space. “Forms of his artistic presentation.”

Osiris was tricked into death by magick and had to overcome it with the formula IAO (Christ, Mithras, resurrecting gods, etc…. similarity to theories of Yugas).

The table reappears and says you’ve translated the vision into reason, this causes new Falls. 

Mark 2:25-26New International Version (NIV)

25 He answered, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? 26 In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”

i.e. profaning the sacred… connection between SHEW-BREAD and SHEW-STONE of Dee? I.e. storming heaven unlawfully…

[Showbread wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showbread)

This cannot be re-opened except by virtue of ARARITA—i.e. equating and identifying every idea with its opposite, thereby being released from fixed truth and completely withdrawing from Ruach. See Chapters of ARARITA for the method: Thesis > Antithesis > Quintessence > Withdrawal > Erasure in the method itself > Reappearance in form appointed by Adept. 

[i.e. since reason and ratiocination profane the “shrine” of understanding [Binah beyond Da’ath], one must exit the Ruach completely via the ARARITA method before being admitted to the “shrine” of the Table (and hence the 3rd order?) Indeed the Sevenfold seal is a symbol of Babylon, Binah, and Babylon triumphs over Choronzon. {The Dragon?}]

Even though joined to inmost mystery of heaven, one must accomplish sevenfold task of earth, even as thou safest angels from greatest to least. Sense shall be darkened and shrine re-veiled after you take back.

If your analytical methods cannot destroy Illusion, try harder, motherfucker. 

SatChitAnanda, 4 powers of Sphinx. Being/Knowledge/Bliss, Will/Courage/Wisdom/Silence. [7 = ARARITA??] That which, being all these, is greater than all these [is this the secret 8th head of the Beast?]

Sorrow upon seeing world as it is (Dukkha, Binah).

JAE says this is the true promise of the Lord of the New Aeon: “Behold! Where are now the darkness and the terror and the lamentation? For ye are born into the new Aeon; ye shall not suffer death. Bind up your girdles of gold! Wreath yourselves with garlands of my unfading flowers! In the nights we will dance together, and in the morning we will go forth to war; for, as my Father liveth that was dead, so do I live and shall never die.”

[Wiki on Abomination of Desolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abomination_of_desolation)

“motionless abomination” (see Aethyr). Designation of Jupiter?

According to 1 Maccabees 1:54, the abomination was erected on the altar of burnt offering [ Qliphoth ]

1 Maccabees[edit]
According to 1 Maccabees 1:54, the abomination was erected on the altar of burnt offering.[4]
1 Maccabees 1:54 "Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side;"
1 Maccabees 6:7 "Also that they had pulled down the abomination, which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his city Bethsura."

The rabbinical consensus is that the expression refers to the desecration of the Second Temple (Herod's Temple) by the erection of a Zeus statue in its sacred precincts byAntiochus IV Epiphanes.[6][7] Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to Manasseh, who is reported to have set up "a carved image … in the house of God".[8][9]
Church Father John Chrysostom understood this to refer to the armies that surrounded Jerusalem and the factions fighting within it which preceded the destruction of the city.[10]

The 1 Maccabees usage of the term points to the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in the mid-2nd century BC. Specifically, he set up an altar to Zeus in the Second Temple in Jerusalem, and sacrificed swine on it around the year 167 BC.[citation needed] Many modern scholars believe that Daniel 9:27, 11:31 and 12:11 are examples of vaticinium ex eventu (prophecies after the event) relating to Antiochus.[11][12]

Many modern Biblical scholars[13] conclude that Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14 are prophecies after the event about the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70 by the Roman generalTitus.[14] Some scholars, including Hermann Detering,[15] see these verses as a vaticinium ex eventu about Emperor Hadrian's attempt to install the statue of Jupiter Capitolinus on the site of the ruined Jewish Temple in Jerusalem leading to the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132-135 AD.

Preterists believe that Jesus quoted this prophecy in Mark 13:14 as referring to an event in his 1st century disciples' immediate future, such as the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD.[16][17]

One commentator relates the prophecy to the actions of Caligula c. 40 AD when he ordered that a golden statue depicting himself as Zeus incarnate be set up in the Temple in Jerusalem.[18] This prospect however, never came to fruition since he was assassinated in 41 AD along with his wife and daughter.[19]

Peter Bolt, head of New Testament at Moore Theological College, believes that the abomination of desolation in Mark 13 refers to the crucifixion of the Son of God; in other words, Jesus is referring to his own impending death.[20]

If Abomination of Desolation = Zeus/Io Pater statue in the Second Temple = Chesed or Demiurge. [As here seen.] Also “changeless abomination”] (changeless nature of imagery. Also the demiurgic figure is seen on a throne behind pillars with sphinxes, which doesn’t *really* resemble the second temple, but is vaguely suggestive of a similar setup

0=2?

From this figure proceed the elements (again 4, chesed, and demiurgos 718.) But why Stele?

“Only those who accept nothing from me can bring anything to me.”

The muttering heard from the idol is the APE OF THOTH; the being on throne has not spoken at all.  

KETHER, silence -> THOTH, false speech [as not silence]
			 APE OF THOTH, caricature/Qliphoth of false speech. -> According to the Ape, his speech is true, because he falsifies falsehood (but wouldn’t it rather be progressive degeneration?)

Ape of Thoth = babbling mind that gets in way of the Silence of the Most High [Bet, Mayan, magician in house of god]

[JAE: Truth = AMTh. Whatsoever of truth that gains voice is a lie, as dual]

**From now on, all statements in Aethyrs speak the language of the Neschemah and not Ruach [we also transition into Briah in next aethyr], meaning that they are paradoxical statements, and must be reverse and reversed again and again, and are true and false at once [NEITHER-NEITHER LANGUAGE]**

Signs up to 7=4 but no further he has them not. This is beyond Adeptus Exemptus and Crowley’s then extent of initiation.

So he was wrong in Wake World to suggest that an MT could pass to higher temples. Distances between grades increase.

Angel: Seeing this “God” (the man behind the curtain) is the Ordeal X—“the horror and loneliness of the First” (Kether), now he can go into the world as the prophet of new Aeon, whether Kether is Not [i.e. 0=2, Kether is the child of any marriage of one particular Hadit with one particular aspect of Nuit, and there are therefore infinite Kethers, and all marriages also produce a twin: H+Y=H+V. Third Being/Third Mind (Kether) and also an ecstasy or dissolution produced by the same event. Magical and Mystical results of act of Love Under Will. 

The voice of Ape of Thoth is pulse of heart and laboring of breast.

[Wheel: Purusha and Prakrit, seer and seen. Wheel: I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. "Come unto me" is a foolish word: for it is I that go.” Kaph wheel, yod axle. This is a Briatic expression of prakriti, Nature.]

Spun by hand (Yod, Kaph, 20, Jupiter), Spermatozoon, Hadit… KAph = peh + kaph = yod * yod, Kaph and Peh are Kteis and Phallus whose union releases Yod.

[It seems pure and white, so therefore distracts people from getting to center of wheel.] 

**WOLF/NEPHESCH/MERCURY:** Betrays greedy and treacherous (Lust of flesh)
**RAVEN/RUACH/SULPHUR:** Betrays melancholy and dishonest [No hostile force is hurtful… enemy is always oneself.] (Lust of mind) (Ravens of Dispersion = A’arab Zareq = Qlipha of Hod)
**LAMB/NESCHAMAH/SALT:** Deceives the very elect. (Simulations of pure prompting of the soul)

Overcome by ABRAHADABRA and ARARITA and NOX (210).

“Angel is I” so makes hard to grasp. I cannot get into I. Therefore mahasatipattha, an a-centric meditation process, must be undertaken before invocations of HGA. 

K&C of HGA. Crowley’s True Will is to lead men to K&C. He discovered this by Sammasati while in China:

In the Noble Eightfold Path, the practice leading to the complete cessation of Unsatisfactoriness, Sammasati is counted as the second factor of the Samadhi Section, the 'Higher Mental Training'. The usual definition of sammasati given in the Discourses is as follows:

"Bhikkhus. What is sammasati? This is call sammasati, namely, that a bhikkhu in this Dhamma Vinaya:

"1. Contemplates the body in the body with effort, sampajañña and sati, eradicating covetousness and distress with regard to the world;[1]

"2. Contemplates feeling in feelings with effort, sampajañña and sati, eradicating covetousness and distress with regard to the world;

"3. Contemplates the mind in the mind with effort, sampajañña and sati, eradicating covetousness and distress with regard to the world;

"4. Contemplates dhammas[2] in dhammas with effort, sampajañña and sati, eradicating covetousness and distress with regard to the world." [D.II.313]

    Another definition, which appears in the Abhidhamma texts, is as follows:

"What is sammasati? Sati means to bear in mind or bring to mind. Sati is the state of recollecting, the state of remembering, the state of non-fading, the state of non-forgetting. Sati means the sati that is a Spiritual Faculty, the sati that is a Spiritual Power, Sammasati, the Sati that is an Enlightenment Factor, that which is a Path Factor and that which is related to the Path. This is what is called sammasati." [Vbh.105, 286]

    Sammasati, as defined in the Discourses, is a synonym for the principles of Dhamma known as the Four Satipatthana. The four elements of this group have the abbreviated names of:

1.	Kayanupassana (contemplation or mindfulness of the body);

2.	Vedananupassana (contemplation or mindfulness of feelings);

3.	Cittanupassana (contemplation or mindfulness of mind);

4.	Dhammanupassana (contemplation or mindfulness of dhammas)

Greek, ICHTHYS - (Jesus fish/ vesicle) (traditionally a notariqon of “Iesous Christos Theou Uios Soter”, but here stated it is not this). 

“This explanation is given among others by Augustine in his Civitate Dei,[7] where he notes that the generating sentence " Ἰησοῦς Χρειστὸς [sic] Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτήρ" has 27 letters, i.e. 3 x 3 x 3, which in that age indicated power. (This suggestion is obviously spurious, resulting from Augustine's ignorance of Greek.) [8] Augustine quotes also an ancient text from the Sibylline oracles[9] whose verses are an acrostic of the generating sentence.”

[JL: Fish here also = Pisces, aeon of Pisces.]

JAE and Crowley tie themselves in knots here, and Crowley never found a solution. The numerical explanation may be as simple as Ἰησοῦς Χρειστὸς Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτήρ = 27 letters = 3x3x3, i.e. the Christic doctrine of Augustine in City of God is identified as of Choronzom.

The City of God [aka City of God Against the Pagans —note the similarities to earlier references to the Abomination of Desolation is Zeus/Io Pater in the 2nd Temple] was written as a political apology for Christianity, saying it did not destroy (disperse) Rome, and posits eternal warfare between God and the Devil, and that the Catholic Church is aligned with God, who uses it and allied countries to fight the Devil. 

City of God Book 18, Chapter 23:

Of the Erythræan Sibyl, Who is Known to Have Sung Many Things About Christ More Plainly Than the Other Sibyls.[1]
Some say the Erythræan sibyl prophesied at this time. Now Varro declares there were many sibyls, and not merely one. This sibyl of Erythræ certainly wrote some things concerning Christ which are quite manifest, and we first read them in the Latin tongue in verses of bad Latin, and unrhythmical, through the unskillfulness, as we afterwards learned, of some interpreter unknown to me. For Flaccianus, a very famous man, who was also a proconsul, a man of most ready eloquence and much learning, when we were speaking about Christ, produced a Greek manuscript, saying that it was the prophecies of the Erythræan sibyl, in which he pointed out a certain passage which had the initial letters of the lines so arranged that these words could be read in them: ᾽Ιησοῦς Χριστος Θεοῦ υιὸς σωτηρ, which means, “Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour.” 

[Flaccanius is unknown outside of Augustine, though is mentioned elsewhere in Aug as criticizing fortune-telling:](https://books.google.com/books?id=ReU2M8cLtGcC&pg=PA1200&lpg=PA1200&dq=Flaccianus&source=bl&ots=wkAsluyKGc&sig=OyZvmGZKjPTmBaJd4Sb1oHTwOII&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAmoVChMIsqycntDqxgIVzSmICh0xNgW-#v=onepage&q=Flaccianus&f=false)

And these verses, of which the initial letters yield that meaning, contain what follows as translated by some one into Latin in good rhythm:

Ι Judgment shall moisten the earth with the sweat of its standard, 

Η Ever enduring, behold the King shall come through the ages, 

Σ Sent to be here in the flesh, and Judge at the last of the world. 

Ο O God, the believing and faithless alike shall behold Thee 

Υ Uplifted with saints, when at last the ages are ended. 

Σ Seated before Him are souls in the flesh for His judgment.  Χ Hid in thick vapors, the while desolate lieth the earth. 

Ρ Rejected by men are the idols and long hidden treasures; 

Ε Earth is consumed by the fire, and it searcheth the ocean and heaven; 

Ι Issuing forth, it destroyeth the terrible portals of hell. 

Σ Saints in their body and soul freedom and light shall inherit; 

Τ Those who are guilty shall burn in fire and brimstone for ever. 

Ο Occult actions revealing, each one shall publish his secrets; 

Σ Secrets of every man’s heart God shall reveal in the light.  Θ Then shall be weeping and wailing, yea, and gnashing of teeth; 

Ε Eclipsed is the sun [Yesod-Tiphareth=Samekh], and silenced the stars in their chorus. 

Ο Over and gone is the splendor of moonlight [Yesod], melted the heaven, 

Υ Uplifted by Him are the valleys, and cast down the mountains.  Υ Utterly gone among men are distinctions of lofty and lowly. 

Ι Into the plains rush the hills, the skies and oceans are mingled. 

Ο Oh, what an end of all things! earth broken in pieces shall perish; 

Σ .... Swelling together at once shall the waters and flames flow in rivers.  Σ Sounding the archangel’s trumpet shall peal down from heaven, 

Ω Over the wicked who groan in their guilt and their manifold sorrows. 

Τ Trembling, the earth shall be opened, revealing chaos and hell. 

Η Every king before God shall stand in that day to be judged. 

Ρ Rivers of fire and brimstone shall fall from the heavens.

[JL NOTE: This bears extreme similarity to the English text of the 19th Call:

THE CALL OR KEY OF THE THIRTY AETHYRS

O YE Heavens which dwell in the first Air, yea are mighty in the parts of 
the Earth, and execute the Judgment of the Highest! Unto you it is said: 
Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the 
brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth,
and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding to 
dispose all things according to the Providence of Him that sitteth on 
the Holy Throne, and rose up in the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be 
governed by her parts, and let there be Division in her, that the glory of her
may be always drunken, and vexed in itself. Her course, let it run with the 
Heavens; and as an handmaid let her serve them. One season, let it confound 
another, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her 
members, let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one Creature 
equal with another. The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them forget their Names. The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His buildings, let them become Caves for the beasts of the Field! Confound her understanding with darkness! For why? it repenteth me that I have made Man. One while let her be known, and another while a stranger: because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that is fallen.

O ye Heavens, arise! The lower heavens beneath you, let them serve you! 
Govern those that govern! Cast down such as fall. Bring forth with those 
that increase, and destroy the rotten. No place let it remain in one number.
Add and diminish until the stars be numbered. Arise! Move! and appear before the Covenant of His mouth, which He hath sworn unto us in His Justice. Open the Mysteries of your Creation, and make us partakers of THE UNDEFILED KNOWLEDGE.]

And, of course, 3^3 = Coronzom, who is *overcome* past ZAX, making this a “blessing”—that everything should be as it is below the abyss, though seen as perfection from the Supernal world. Also not the Erytherean sibil = Binah or Babalon. 

In these Latin verses the meaning of the Greek is correctly given, although not in the exact order of the lines as connected with the initial letters; for in three of them, the fifth, eighteenth, and nineteenth, where the Greek letter Υ occurs, Latin words could not be found beginning with the corresponding letter, and yielding a suitable meaning. So that, if we note down together the initial letters of all the lines in our Latin translation except those three in which we retain the letter Υ in the proper place, they will express in five Greek words this meaning, “Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour.” And the verses are twenty-seven, which is the cube of three. For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if tripled, so as to rise from the superficial square to the cube, comes to twenty-seven. But if you join the initial letters of these five Greek words, ᾽Ιησοῦς Χριστος Θεοῦ υἰὸς σωτήρ, which mean, “Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour,” they will make the word ἰχδὺς, that is, “fish,” in which word Christ is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that is, to exist, without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth of waters.[2]

Main article: Cumaean Sibyl

The sibyl who most concerned the Romans was the Cumaean Sibyl, located near the Greek city of Naples, whom Virgil's Aeneas consults before his descent to the lower world (Aeneid book VI: 10). Burkert notes (1985, p 117) that the conquest of Cumae by the Oscans in the 5th century destroyed the tradition, but provides a terminus ante quem for a Cumaean sibyl. It was she who supposedly sold to Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, the original Sibylline books. Christians were especially impressed with the Cumaean Sibyl, for in Virgil's Fourth Eclogue she foretells the coming of a savior – possibly a flattering reference to the poet's patron – whom Christians identified as Jesus.[18][19][20]]

But this sibyl, whether she is the Erythræan, or, as some rather believe, the Cumæan, in her whole poem, of which this is a very small portion, not only has nothing that can relate to the worship of the false or feigned gods, but rather speaks against them and their worshippers in such a way that we might even think she ought to be reckoned among those who belong to the city of God. Lactantius also inserted in his work the prophecies about Christ of a certain sibyl, he does not say which. But I have thought fit to combine in a single extract, which may seem long, what he has set down in many short quotations. She says, “Afterward He shall come into the injurious hands of the unbelieving, and they will give God buffets with profane hands, and with impure mouth will spit out envenomed spittle; but He will with simplicity yield His holy back to stripes. And He will hold His peace when struck with the fist, that no one may find out what word, or whence, He comes to speak to hell; and He shall be crowned with a crown of thorns. And they gave Him gall for meat, and vinegar for His thirst: they will spread this table of inhospitality. For thou thyself, being foolish, hast not understood thy God, deluding the minds of mortals, but hast both crowned Him with thorns and mingled for Him bitter gall. But the veil of the temple shall be rent; and at midday it shall be darker than night for three hours. And He shall die the death, taking sleep for three days; and then returning from hell, He first shall come to the light, the beginning of the resurrection being shown to the recalled.” Lactantius made use of these sibylline testimonies, introducing them bit by bit in the course of his discussion as the things he intended to prove seemed to require, and we have set them down in one connected series, uninterrupted by comment, only taking care to mark them by capitals, if only the transcribers do not neglect to preserve them hereafter. Some writers, indeed, say that the Erythræan sibyl was not in the time of Romulus, but of the Trojan war.

"The City of God Against the Pagans" by St. Augustine is a cornerstone of Western thought, in which the critical Catholic theologist decries the number of teenage Wiccans with black nail polish, pentagram necklaces and bo-staffs that are always playing "Magic: The Gathering" in front of the Cinnabon in the mall food court by his house. It was followed three years later by a less popular work, "The City of God Against the Furries."

initials of five greek, five egyptian dieties - tremendous power : Isis/Cneph/Thoth/Uramoth/Sebek; I/Ch/Themis/Uranus/Selene. All forms of Binah. Create magical formula as in Book 4 part 3.  These also represent Sephirah 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. {JAE: Nobody’s got the right solution}

hga and self crucified as if face to face - i believe this is the 6º oto grip. [Also 8=3 sign, Mater Triumphans]

No unity—Unity can only be accomplished when impulse comes from above. [20th aethyr]

OISIRIS WAS BLACK GOD = [Duat] Osiris is of the nature of Binah, black, and he must be annihilated to attain Binah. Love of Binah is that of the Queen Scorpion who devours her mate. Female devouring the male after sex is union with Binah! “One must not be the child but the Mother” — i.e. the Osiris formula is over, Crowley must proceed from LVX to NOX, the Pathway of Night.

Note: Realized that the I Ching, being the Book of Changes and therefore of Chokmah, and above the Abyss, speaks in Supernal language—this is why it never seems to give a direct answer. It answers non-dually.

Comment: “The Vault of preparation for the Ceremony of Magister Templi. The Veil is the Crucifixion, symbol of the dead Aeon. The first ordeal is undergone.”

[JL: “Zen” does indeed seem to be a fitting description of Hod in Briah?]

ZEN = 69 = ABVS, manger/stable/enclosure. HGA prepares candidate below any normal sphere of consciousness. 

[ZEN = 65, HGA/LXV, Adonai, temple, silence] Compare Hod in Atziluth, Aethyr 8, for KC HGA

Combines elements of the 5=6 GD and 2=9 A.’.A.’. initiations. [Vault of Adepti/King’s Chamber—my ritual in Hemet. Masonic Chamber of Reflection for 3rd Order.]

If you bring in the implements of crucifixion, they will be used on you.

Nails = 3 desires (vau vau vau 666) = desire for light, life, love [gunther: LLLL at base of pyramid of aspirant] [This applies only to this step, not to Man of Earth]

Thorns = Thoughts

Whips = Regrets

Wine = Unsteadiness in ecstasy (See Liber AL)

Spear = Attachment

Free self from all attachment, desires, mind. (Buddhism)

Christ as Bat, thieves as two children (ATU XIX? Inversion of Sun. Qlipha of Resh/Tiphareth?) Night full of hideous things and howling (Goetia?) If you change so much as a letter the holy word is blasphemed (fill/kill). This is the “empty shell” of mystery of ZEN [JL: Indeed - the Qlipha of Resh or Tiphareth in Briah]

Reference to Exodus 33:22-23: Many Adepts’s eyes have failed before the glory of thy countenance

“22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:

23 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.”
Portal signs given. 72 whirling signs of fiery light (Shemham - related to “Howlings” mentioned before as being attributed to the Goetia)

Parting of Veil = Opening Briah

Latin QBL Simplex, 72 = ABIEGNUS. also IGNIS DEI and VACUUM

72 = A’aB, secret nature of Atziluth. [Meatus/Word?] Cone of Phallus of Iacchus, with ruby pyramid [Phallus, 831, 3 x 277, magician, lunar white wand, NVRA, MQL LBNH, ChRTM, ARIN the Ark, related mathematically to Great Pyramid of Cheops/Gizeh. (?)

KIng’s Chamber (Reception AL) is the vault of the adepts—i.e. the vault of the adepts is a “vile imitation” of it. [Liber AL, also City of Pyramids - 5=6 literally entombed in a pyramid] also = Adytum in BOTA.

Mons Cavernarum, 156 in Latin QBL (Cavern of Mt Abigenus)

4 sides + roof + floor + chamber itself = 7 [not seven sides, it is a cube—Sepher Yetzirah, cube of space, Cubical Stone, 18º SR {Rosicrucian, as the Tomb of CR in GD—earlier reflection!]. {Just as Hexagram = 7 planets because center, Sol, is implied} So Pastos = 7. No furniture or symbols. Blue brilliant light of Horus (! Babaji) Blue only because imperfection of eyes (as blue sky). [Mental awakening into “Cube” in Liber 73, Magus initiation] Million insane images (333). Expiry into NOX (VII I:40) - Crowley does not understand this. Jab at “masters” of Theosophy that lend momentary credence to their insane babble. If you do not accept annihilation, you become a black brother and batshit insane babbler.

PAstos as vacuum and angel understood as am “empty God” into which he will expire. (E and N in ZEN)

Samekh, HGA lifts up

Red = essence of Horus as stereotype of HGA

Great Pyramid height to base is 5:8, golden mean, also = Pentagram. 

Symbolic crossing of abyss, helped by angel, unlike actual where there is no help. 

THE ANGEL DEALETH NOT WITH THE LITTLE PILE OF DUST IN THE CITY OF THE PYRAMIDS, BUT WITH THE STAR THAT IS CAST FORTH TO GIVE LIGHT TO THE EARTH.

Pastos = Chamber of Annihilation, burnt up to pyramid/cone/phallus.  Pyramid within cone (purest rose/cross). representing new universe. established on 4 elements divided into 72, all categories time/space/causality etc. 

And then there is a birth chamber, given refreshments… He can’t do it yet.

Zelator initiation 2=9 is described. {Which I did} - i.e. 2=9 A.’.A.’. is Hod in Briah( or admits to?? ??)

Wait no it’s: 

NEW METHOD OF DEEPLY PARTAKING IN EACH AETHYR—in Samadhi, rather than hovering in Yetzirah(!)

Do Cadavaris, and then at end:
	Feast
	banish all elements/planets/signs/sephiroth [Liber YOD]
	Take Holy Table for altar
	Call of Aethyr written in Enochian or Alphabet of Daggers on virgin vellum
	Then conjure Aethyr
	Burn text in lamp.
	Kneel before holy table (in Dragon Asana) and you will get the vision. 

Various inks—a color scale of the Aethyrs is here give. Change not so much as the style of a letter or holy name blasphemed. 
Await the completion of 91st hour of retirement [see 91 days of Magus initiation] to open door. 

91 = 3 days, 19 hours. 

Crowley on Kelly: “No hint of the sublimity and profundity of such visions as the present series in the working of that Adept.”

Author: “For this is a holy mystery, and he that did first attain to reveal the alphabet thereof, perceived not one ten-thousandth part of the fringe that is upon its vesture.”

She says: “Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so much of God as thy capacity affordeth thee.” Pierce deeply into aethyr (more and more the case); TAN transforms judgment into justice.

Justice in Enochian = BALATANU, in 2nd Aethyr. BAL-A-TAN-U [JAE: BALTAN is justice, BALZIZRAS is judgment/ Bal and Tan in Heb=93]

Maat.

Middle pillar as a shining filament of quartz, from abyss to abyss, in middle winged disk of Hadit as any viewpoint whatever, and in alphabet of daggers: Torsion of iniquity—twisting one’s point of view is to obtain a false idea. Rashith ha-Gilgalim is first appearance of evil. 

Angel in black diamonds {ain}: Woe unto second/Demiurge; first/Microprosopus (Kether overturned-see Aethyr 20). Hail Nuit and Hadit because they HAVE NO MOTION. space cannot move. The point goes: "I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. "Come unto me" is a foolish word: for it is I that go.", but it doesn't matter how we represent these ideas, because if we did, we would be unable to measure phenomena. [" If this be not aright; if ye confound the space-marks, saying: They are one; or saying, They are many; if the ritual be not ever unto me: then expect the direful judgments of Ra Hoor Khuit!"]

Angel as realized love, absorbed in Nuit. Severity and Mercy joined/balanced in Leo; Leo is one with Libra, as Lamed is the universe in extension.

TAN = Mercy.

Blue feather of Maat = justice = mercy. Truth is delight. 
Lunar angel of Gimel. Justice is equity truth/falsehood. 
5th chakra (lunar dew? Shiva Samhita - the One stands in the blue-silver moonlight in Gimel)

"Your falsehood is but a little falser than your truth"

[Assiah = astrological influences in literal space upon visions???]

Truth = proximity to Adonai; therefore the only approximation of truth is Oath to Adonai. 

The Weighing of Maat (Hall of Dead) begins the Chemical Wedding (ritual with Season)—if not found wanting, one spark of fire within, so dense and intense that it cannot be moved, not by air, water or earth. [Y HVH] [Spark as Yod]. FUCK.
THE SPARK IS HADIT—and cannot be moved because it is already in motion at the limit of velocity. And this fire is that which it is written of "Hear thou the Voice of fire!" and the voice of fire = Liber AL, chapter 2, revealed to 666 by Aiwass.

"And when, after all the Phantoms are vanished thou shalt see that holy and formless Fire, that Fire which darts and flashes through the hidden depths of the Universe, hear thou the voice of Fire." Oracles of Zoroaster.

emerald altar, w heads of 4 beasts (ATU XXI) in turq and rock-crystal [chokmah/malkuth] floor is of Nuit., full of universal mercury/quicksilver [JAE: semen of stars].

Above the Altar is Pan. He is worshipped as follows in the various orders:

5=6 : Man (Tiphareth)
6=5 : Goat (Medes Khem) (Geburah)
7=4 : Ram (Amoun) (Chesed)
8=3 : Crab (Star-Sponge Vision) (Binah)
9=2 : Ibis (Thoth) (Chokmah)
10=1 : Golden Hawk (RHK) (Keyther)
The secret/unnamed 11=0 (or 0=0) grade: AIN SOPH: Negative only.

The altar is the Holy 12fold Table of OIT—the center of the Holy Table. Crowley attributes these 12 Enochian letters to the 12 signs of the Zodiac, as follows:

Libra			Sagittarius		Leo
Pisces		Cancer				Capricorn
Cancer		Pisces				Cancer
Libra			Libra					Virgo

OIT also initials Olalam Imal Tutulu VII 7:6

Pan is upon it, his voice is Silence, but the echo comes back from the walls of the ampitheater, and it is speech. 3&4 = days of quarter of moon, seventh day the sabbath; 3x4 = Sabbath of Adepts, the form revealed in Aethyr ZID. 

This will be understood by a pool of clear water that is the sweat of thy brow. oil of 13 rivers from beard of macrop. 

Table = universe, every star a letter of the Book of Enoch. The Book of Enoch drawn therefrom by inscrutable mystery , known only to Angels and holy sevenfold table. 

Crowley is tested by Adepts from 5=6 to 8=3 and found prepared for each Sephira, though not at 9=2. 

Languages:
5=6 = Greek
6=5 = Latin
7=4 = Enochian
8=3 = Sanskrit
9=2 = Hebrew

Most secret names of God, from Holy Table: ORLO, ILRO, TULE

Each can be interpreted like INRI.

And: 

OIT = Invokes Fire

RLU = Water

LRL = Air

OOE = Earth

Read diagonally, every letter and letter combination is a devil, eil magick.

I [GON] above LLL [Triad of Urs - suggesting .'. ?] dominateth table and preserveth peace of universe (Crowley is not sure why, thinks it may suggest Middle Pillar by shape.) I also = Sag, Samekh; C=Cancer, path to Binah through Cheth (Liber Cheth).

The seven talismans contain the mysteries of drawing forth the letters.

Letters of circumference declare glory of Nuit, that begins with Aries [PA = B = Aries] [There are 22 letters to a side if PA is counted  at beginning and not end as beginning the next sequence. Hence the 22 paths, Elements+Planets+Zodiac. i.e. Central 12 = Zodiac and Elements, 7 Seals = Planets, Outer Rung = 22 Paths] [Whence Hexagram? Planets again. Macro/microcosm, outwith is 333-see my notes from Dee.] 22 letters also = stars, Nuit.

Adepts chant oratorio for seven instruments, one dominant theme of rapture, which contains universe in totality, bringing 333 to ruin. 

There is one God within the Tablet, and letters of the stars in his crown [classic image of 12-rayed or starred crown] = Orion, Pleiades, Aldebaran, Alpha Centauri, Cor Leonis, Cor Scorpionis, Spica, Pole-Star, Hercules, Regulus, Aquila, Ram's Eye. = 12 stars, presumably, that represent the 12 zodiacal regions [Across the equinoctal line? Note my earlier research on plotting the 22 Hebrew letters across the equinoctal line of the galaxy {what is that thing called again?}.]

[Crowley: Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus say that Isis = Sirius, Horus = Orion, Typhon = Great Bear]

[Note: The Zodiac likely comes from Babylon, 1st millenia BC]

Draw the sigil of that name on a map of the stars, and because some letters are alike, know stars = tribes and nations [again zodiacal attributions from G.D. - Crowley: Different systems = different systems of physical motion for certain groups]

The letter of a star is but the totem thereof, and the letter representeth not the whole nature of the star, but each star must be known by itself in the wisdom of Thoth. [Also living stars]

Attribution of Fixed Stars to Enochian Alphabet: Not worked out by Crowley, and pertains to grade 9=2. Work this out from the book discovered on Hebrew and the sky.  - J. H. Broome, Astral Origin of the Emblems, the zodiacal signs...

Below are the Hebrew letters associated with the constellations of the zodiac (which map along the celestial equator) from Broome. Broome derives the attributions by noting that each Hebrew letter is actually derived explicitly or implicitly from the shape of each given constellation. The Enochian attributions given are then derived from Hebrew via the correspondences between Enochian and Hebrew given in Eshelman. No direct physical mapping of the Enochian characters to the constellations has yet been attempted.

Aleph : Taurus (Aldebaran) : Na

Bet : Gemini (Castor/Pollux) : [None given]

Gimel : Cancer : Gisg, Or

Leo : Daleth (Regulus) : [None given]

Heh : Virgo (Spica) : Tal

Vau : Libra (Zubenelakrab) : Un

Zayin : Scorpio (Antares) : Fam

Cheth : Sagittarius : Ur

Teth : Capricornus : Ged, Gal

Yod : Aquarius : Graph

Kaph : Pisces : [None given]

Lamed : Aries (Arietis) : Med

Mem : Eridanus : Ger

Nun : Southern Fish (Fomalhaut) : Drux

Samekh : Band of Pisces : Gon

A'ayin : Pleiades (Alcyone) : Van

Peh : Beta in Taurus : [None given]

Tzaddi : Orion (Betelgeuse, Rigel) : Pa {tz not star}

Qoph : Belt of Orion : Don

Resh : (Delta) Canis Major : [None given]

Shin : Canis Major (Sirius) : Veh, Gal

Tau : Southern Cross : Pa

Thls seems unsatisfactory, likely because the Hebrew attributions in Eshelman have been derived FROM the Zodiacal attributions in Crowley, and are then mapped backward onto Broome's Hebrew. A simpler scheme might simply be sticking with the Zodiacal attributions of the Alphabet and then locating each star within the sidereal zodiacal quadrant.

Un: Taurus
Pa : Aries
Graph : Virgo
Ged: Leo
Gon: Sagittarius
Ur: Cancer
Tal: Aquarius
Drux: Scorpio
Med: Libra
Mals: Cancer
Don: Pisces
Fam: Gemini
Van: Capricorn
Leo: Ceph

[Wait, no... or yes? eh?]

Using Broome's attributions would tabulate as follows from the Aethyr:

Orion: Pa
Pleiades: Van
Aldebaran: Na
Alpha Centauri: [? in Centauri]
Cor Leonis [Regulus]: [?] 
Cor Scorpionis [Scorpio]: Fam
Spica: Tal
Pole-Star [Polaris, Ursa Minor]: [?[
Hercules: [?]
Regulus: [?] [mentioned twice-see note]
Aquila: [?]
Ram's Eye [Aries?]: Med

As we can see, neither method proves satisfactory at present.

Saturn conceived as dragon Theli, referred to Binah (this dragon appears in Sefer Yetzirah). Also serpent of Kundalini that eventually becomes serpent eating its own tail (Nuit) (!) python = typhon = 86 in latin, serpens, draco niger, sapientia

Chapter VI:

1. In proof of these things, and witnessing faithfully are the Universe, the Year of time, and Man himself, the Microcosm. He fixed these as testimonies of the Triad, the Heptad, and the Dodecad; the twelve constellations rulers of the world, the Dragon (THELE) Tali which environs the universe, and the microcosm, man.

The triad, fire, water, and air; the fire above, the water below, and the air in the midst. The proof of which is that air is a participator with both.

2. Tali, the Dragon, is above the Universe, as a king on his throne; the sphere in the year as a king in his State, the Heart of man as a king in warfare.

And our God made the states of opposition, good and evil, good from the good, and evil from the evil. Happiness is reserved for the just, and misery for the wicked ones.

[There is a 6 1/2 hour gap here which is where Crowley was sodomized by Neuberg on Da'leh Addin, in circle of rocks inscribed with words of power. He had to tear his repression from his heart before he could cross the Abyss. He was now disconnected from his personality as a Babe of the Abyss.]

Binah as *absolute negation* of light. Akasa is black egg - even if you are master of pentagram and rose (50 gates of binah. 50=scorpio. even negates the spark? Black is the color of the HIGHEST as it has unresistingly absorbed all light (see LXV).

you wanted 4 powers, 7 delights, 12 emancipations, 22 privileges and 49 manifestations - and you have become as one of these. They are PYRAMIDS, their hoods and robes pyramids. pyramid is temple of initiation AND a tomb. there is no life in them. they have thrown away their sandals of light (ankh = life, into Ruach). no more visions or glories, or beatific vision of tiphareth—there are none of the lower sephirah here, for here is UNDERSTANDING. one with Primeval things. so is pure wisdom pure chance [CHAOS MAGICK], pure understanding is silence

70 (Eye) / 333 = 0.210 repeating, NOX

333 is referred to as Triple Aleph (? ah - 111 x 3)

They are shut up and All their achievements are gone from them: "I saw Satan like lightning fall from Heaven." Like 10:18—as a flaming sword dropped through Abyss, where four beasts watch and ward, cast into the sphere the adept will do its work in—the samkharas are reconstituted below the abyss so that they can function as a 4=7, in the grade which their sphere of gravity tends. 

50 are the gates of Understanding, and 156 are the seasons thereof. And the name of every season is Death (106). Nun/Scorpio symbolism. Seasons = lunar months.

Prepared for beauty and delight thereof, and because Tetragrammaton Elohim planted a garden eastward in Eden. . every flower brings forth a maiden, but one brings forth a new NEMO male-child [successor-Rosicrucian doctrine], but you know not which.

He torments the flowers, as heavy is the work. Karma yoga from on high = you don't see the rewards.

Work performed in absolute (lucid) darkness; on ROOTS of plant; even if events are outwardly hurtful they are exactly what each plant needs—the Ordeals (NOT conducted by occult teacher but by S.'.S.'.) Compassion, as in Tzaddi 26-27 - rooting out of weeds and watering of flowers

Man of Earth = Adherent
Lover = Giveth his life unto the work among men

Ability of 8=3 to understand anything by waiting for answer to come into his mind (but Eshelman says 1=10 will already possess it—ask a question and the answer will appear upon clear formulation of question)

[I try asking about Devi. Answer is "give her time"]

NEMO must understand everything

Aethyrs 1-15 there is no vision and no voice save for he that is NEMO. if you look for vision and voice therein you are led astray. (nothing outside one's own samadhi? no subject/object?) If you go past Aethyr 15 and are not NEMO, you will be led astray. 

All outwith the 15th aethyr is delusion, unless you have the word and sign, authority from superior (George Cecil Jones), and he was licensed an 8=3 in December 1906.

Angel in black diamonds {ain}: Woe unto second/Demiurge; first/Microprosopus (Kether overturned-see Aethyr 20). Hail Nuit and Hadit because they HAVE NO MOTION. space cannot move. The point goes: "I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle.

Libra			Sagittarius		Leo

Cancer		Pisces				Cancer
Libra			Libra					Virgo

Pan is upon it, his voice is Silence, but the echo comes back from the walls of the ampitheater, and it is speech. 3&4 = days of quarter of moon, seventh day the sabbath; 3x4 = Sabbath of Adepts, the form revealed in Aethyr ZID.

I [GON] above LLL [Triad of Urs - suggesting .'. ?] dominateth table and preserveth peace of universe (Crowley is not sure why, thinks it may suggest Middle Pillar by shape.) I also = Sag, Samekh; C=Cancer, path to Binah through Cheth (Liber Cheth).

The seven talismans contain the mysteries of drawing forth the letters.

Letters of circumference declare glory of Nuit, that begins with Aries [PA = B = Aries] [There are 22 letters to a side if PA is counted  at beginning and not end as beginning the next sequence. Hence the 22 paths, Elements+Planets+Zodiac. i.e. Central 12 = Zodiac and Elements, 7 Seals = Planets, Outer Rung = 22 Paths] [Whence Hexagram? Planets again. Macro/microcosm, outwith is 333-see my notes from Dee.] 22 letters also = stars, Nuit.

Adepts chant oratorio for seven instruments, one dominant theme of rapture, which contains universe in totality, bringing 333 to ruin. 

There is one God within the Tablet, and letters of the stars in his crown [classic image of 12-rayed or starred crown] = Orion, Pleiades, Aldebaran, Alpha Centauri, Cor Leonis, Cor Scorpionis, Spica, Pole-Star, Hercules, Regulus, Aquila, Ram's Eye. = 12 stars, presumably, that represent the 12 zodiacal regions [Across the equinoctal line? Note my earlier research on plotting the 22 Hebrew letters across the equinoctal line of the galaxy {what is that thing called again?}.]

[Crowley: Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus say that Isis = Sirius, Horus = Orion, Typhon = Great Bear]

[Note: The Zodiac likely comes from Babylon, 1st millenia BC]

Draw the sigil of that name on a map of the stars, and because some letters are alike, know stars = tribes and nations [again zodiacal attributions from G.D. - Crowley: Different systems = different systems of physical motion for certain groups]

The letter of a star is but the totem thereof, and the letter representeth not the whole nature of the star, but each star must be known by itself in the wisdom of Thoth. [Also living stars]

Attribution of Fixed Stars to Enochian Alphabet: Not worked out by Crowley, and pertains to grade 9=2. Work this out from the book discovered on Hebrew and the sky.  - J. H. Broome, Astral Origin of the Emblems, the zodiacal signs...

Below are the Hebrew letters associated with the constellations of the zodiac (which map along the celestial equator) from Broome. Broome derives the attributions by noting that each Hebrew letter is actually derived explicitly or implicitly from the shape of each given constellation. The Enochian attributions given are then derived from Hebrew via the correspondences between Enochian and Hebrew given in Eshelman. No direct physical mapping of the Enochian characters to the constellations has yet been attempted.

Aleph : Taurus (Aldebaran) : Na

Bet : Gemini (Castor/Pollux) : [None given]

Gimel : Cancer : Gisg, Or

Leo : Daleth (Regulus) : [None given]

Heh : Virgo (Spica) : Tal

Lamed : Aries (Arietis) : Med

Samekh : Band of Pisces : Gon

Peh : Beta in Taurus : [None given]

Qoph : Belt of Orion : Don

Resh : (Delta) Canis Major : [None given]

Shin : Canis Major (Sirius) : Veh, Gal

Tau : Southern Cross : Pa

Thls seems unsatisfactory, likely because the Hebrew attributions in Eshelman have been derived FROM the Zodiacal attributions in Crowley, and are then mapped backward onto Broome's Hebrew. A simpler scheme might simply be sticking with the Zodiacal attributions of the Alphabet and then locating each star within the sidereal zodiacal quadrant.

Un: Taurus
Pa : Aries
Graph : Virgo
Ged: Leo
Gon: Sagittarius
Ur: Cancer
Tal: Aquarius
Drux: Scorpio
Med: Libra
Mals: Cancer
Don: Pisces
Fam: Gemini
Van: Capricorn
Leo: Ceph

[Wait, no... or yes? eh?]

Using Broome's attributions would tabulate as follows from the Aethyr:

Orion: Pa
Pleiades: Van
Aldebaran: Na
Alpha Centauri: [? in Centauri]
Cor Leonis [Regulus]: [?] 
Cor Scorpionis [Scorpio]: Fam
Spica: Tal
Pole-Star [Polaris, Ursa Minor]: [?[
Hercules: [?]
Regulus: [?] [mentioned twice-see note]
Aquila: [?]
Ram's Eye [Aries?]: Med

As we can see, neither method proves satisfactory at present.

2. Tali, the Dragon, is above the Universe, as a king on his throne; the sphere in the year as a king in his State, the Heart of man as a king in warfare.

And our God made the states of opposition, good and evil, good from the good, and evil from the evil. Happiness is reserved for the just, and misery for the wicked ones.

The cup here radiates a "ruddy glow" (menstruation); seen in ATU VII of Thoth deck. Perfume of RHK, from cakes of light. The cup is that of Babalon, filled with blood of saints. = fermented by her breath (air?)[aging of adept, time has been taken], wine of sacrament, wine of the sabbath, in holy assembly she has poured it out for worshippers, and they have become drunk thereof, so that face to face they have beheld father (become NEMO). by her murders and fornications she seduces the world - manifested truth of father (Y). (Babalon = H?)
the glory of my father = 45 = adam (amth, truth, or adam kadmon?)

true worshippers of the highest is common phrase in nochian. HOATH IAIDA = 116 = miyyeyno, from his wine, and LALHIM- unto the gods

Every thought is destroyed by the blood (NOX). Its name is Compassion=the sacrament of suffering, partaken of by the true worshippers of the Highest. [Compassion the Vice of Kings - they get high on it]

[SO = the Macguyver ayahuasca vision IS the cup of Babalon—drunk on the blood of the saints [the entire Qliphothic tree]—the compassion of the Tibetans. Also, obviously, the practical application is Tonglen.] In this ecstasy there is no pain, the passivity is giving up self to the beloved.

Mystery of Babalon, mother of abominations, she has given herself to everything and made herself the servant of each, and is become the mistress of all.

From the Urn:

Dec. 23.

Ether. The bride had picked up a book at random from the shelves of the Hotel. “Two parts of Hydrogen combine with one of Oxygen,” she read, “to form water.” “The acceleration due to gravitation is 32 feet per second.” “The beast!” she cried; “he does not understand Love!” The above is a parable for 9°=2ás, in staircases. But—which side are you on; and why? [beyond Binah?]

She will not rest from her adulteries until the blood of all life is gathered up therein. Father renewed eternally, universe unfoldeth itself as a rose, and shutteth itself up as a cross that is a cub (18º SR). 

Final stage of YHVH formula

Aethyrs = Rose (universe unfolds like a rose) = Nuit expanding
Cross = Cubic stone of material universe inside = Hadit collapsing inward/folding (18º)

This is comedy of Pan, mystery of Dionysus Zagreus, secret of Rosicrucians, heart of ritual of Vault of Adepti in Mt. Abiegnus. [= IXº OTO] [Adept born by HGA to Abyss, all stages from 5=6 to 8=3 technical changes/processes of K&C where one pours oneself wholly into what one loves most]

9 x 7 = 63. 6+3 = 9
9 x 127 = 1143. = 9
9 x 9 = 81 = 9
9 * 63189 = 568701 = 27 = 9 (!!!)

Wiki:

In base 10 a positive number is divisible by nine if and only if its digital root is 9.[8] That is, if you multiply nine by any natural number, and repeatedly add the digits of the answer until it is just one digit, you will end up with nine:

2 × 9 = 18 (1 + 8 = 9)

3 × 9 = 27 (2 + 7 = 9)

9 × 9 = 81 (8 + 1 = 9)

121 × 9 = 1089 (1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18; 1 + 8 = 9)

234 × 9 = 2106 (2 + 1 + 0 + 6 = 9)

578329 × 9 = 5204961 (5 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 27; 2 + 7 = 9)

482729235601 × 9 = 4344563120409 (4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 9 = 45; 4 + 5 = 9)

There are other interesting patterns involving multiples of nine:

12345679 x 9 = 111111111

12345679 x 18 = 222222222

12345679 x 81 = 999999999

This works for all the multiples of 9. n = 3 is the only other n > 1 such that a number is divisible by n if and only if its digital root is n. In base N, the divisors of N − 1 have this property. Another consequence of 9 being 10 − 1, is that it is also a Kaprekar number.

The difference between a base-10 positive integer and the sum of its digits is a whole multiple of nine. Examples:

The sum of the digits of 41 is 5, and 41-5 = 36. The digital root of 36 is 3+6 = 9, which, as explained above, demonstrates that it is divisible by nine.

The sum of the digits of 35967930 is 3+5+9+6+7+9+3+0 = 42, and 35967930-42 = 35967888. The digital root of 35967888 is 3+5+9+6+7+8+8+8 = 54, 5+4 = 9.

Subtracting two base-10 positive integers that are transpositions of each other yields a number that is a whole multiple of nine. Examples:

41 - 14 = 27 (2 + 7 = 9)

36957930 - 35967930 = 990000, a multiple of nine.

This works regardless of the number of digits that are transposed. For example, the largest transposition of 35967930 is 99765330 (all digits in descending order) and its smallest transposition is 03356799 (all digits in ascending order); subtracting pairs of these numbers produces:

99765330 - 35967930 = 63797400; 6+3+7+9+7+4+0+0 = 36; 3+6 = 9.

99765330 - 03356799 = 96408531; 9+6+4+0+8+5+3+1 = 36; 3+6 = 9.

35967930 - 03356799 = 32611131; 3+2+6+1+1+1+3+1 = 18; 1+8 = 9.

He who understands (Nemo) must go out to outermost abyss to speak with he that is set above the 4-fold terror, the princes of evil, even unto Choronzon himself.

Only the servants of BABALON may deal/speak with him and his servants, because they have UNDERSTANDING, and 333 and his servants do not (i.e. do not extend past Da'ath).

[Aethyr 11 = 11 = Da'ath?]

Abyss = sickness of aspiration, sickness of will, sickness of essence of all, and there is neither word nor thought wherein the image of its image is reflected [reflected = yesod?]

If you go to the Abyss without understanding, you bow to the chains of Choronzon (chain = magical weapon of Da'ath, used to bind Da'ath in GD rites, 333 links) [ie are ruled by machine of reactive mind]. Then you become a black brother, "bearer of corruption." poisoning the fire from heaven instead of letting it turn you to ash

Interesting: You have to be NEMO *before* facing 333.

universe is shaken/not shaken by 333. [JL: not shaken = disruption of stability of change? if change = stability, to NOT shake = destabilize. formula of Black Brothers = resistance to change, change being Chokmah 9=2 even as 2=9, Yesod]

[JAE: This is what NEUBURG experienced in the Aethyr, and is NOT Crowley's experience of crossing the Abyss.]

[There were three pigeons sacrificed around the triangle. Crowley obscures the fact here that he put HIMSELF in the triangle, robed and in Thunderbolt Asana, to have 333 invoked on himself as the living material basis, in concentration and silence, retired into meditation. JAE = See Tarot cards for what Crowley experienced. Solar-phallic bhakti taken to peak expression, flashpoint; concentrated in one's own Inner Teacher; and then dissolved into infinite dark of space]

[Choronzon thus manifests in the Qlipha of Frater O.M. himself, that which is left when the Adept is withdrawn into meditation. Neuberg insisted till late in life that he ACTUALLY fought a demon. Neuberg=super psychic. Neuburg's circle was attuned to element of Air—i.e. he was making sure that HE HIMSELF DID NOT CROSS THE ABYSS by getting sucked into Crowley's vortex. So he was kept in air and his intellect was kept busy. Circle is surrounded by Air and Yesod names: YHVH and SDY AL ChY; and ARARITA. Added, the names = 1202, BShA'aRICM, "within your gates" (gates of prior aethyr, or 50 gates of binah?) he is given air weapons: quill of scribe and magic dagger.

I am the Master of Form [a lie as it is not a unified being], and from me all forms proceed.

I am I. = assertion that blocks transcendence of the Abyss; the motto of the Dark Brothers in Aethyr 12.

**DO NOT DERIVE ANY DOCTRINE FROM THE UTTERANCES OF 333 HEREIN**

This false being, conscious it is not a true being, feels fear. fear = pain, malice, envy, and hatred from supposed creator, because the supposed blessing of creation has been withheld from the "Bundle".

[I.e. ego. And compare to Tibetan teachings that there is no Atman, only a "bundle" of sense-impressions which thinks itself a unified being. Hence this monstrosity—this is the root of the self, challenged as unreal and fighting back. Also note the traditional attribution that there are "333 million gods" in Hinduism (Atman).]

Crowley is robed in Thunderbolt, unmoving. But 333 speaks with his voice/wears his face, presenting hallucinatory forms to Neuberg.

Courtesan (Venus): God of Laughter. (Peter Carroll on laughter.) Bows before divine names but begs for mercy to break the circle. "you have mastered me, lemme come zuk ya dick" = appeal to pride

he hates the "servants of the Most High" (IAIDA: INRI:IAO; YHVH/Tetragrammaton—see Wake World; Aethyr 29)

[JAE: Da'ath is intellect run amok, but there is an inner aspect which is the ecstasy of Babalon and unity w Supernals. But this has nothing to do w 333. Da'ath is NOT the Abyss, even though it abides WITHIN the Abyss.]

There is no cry in ZAX like the others... 333 is dispersion and cannot fix his mind upon any one thing for long (ADD generation). 

You can't argue with him because it encourages him. You can't threaten him w anger pain and hell, because he is all these things.

prevailed against kingdom of son, and torn off his Phallus; [osiris]
against kingdom of Holy Ghost shall I strive and not prevail.

3 slain doves are 3fold blasphemy against them, but blood makes sand fertile, and I writhe in blackness and orror of hate and prevail not (this actually happened, the sand grew plants when they checked later)

Horror will be given through another Seer, who will be slain as a result of his revealing. The present seer, who is NOT Perdurabo, sees not the horror, because he is shut up and has no name (is NEMO).

### NOTE BY SCRIBE (OV)

[This gives **exact** instructions for overcoming Choronzon.

(Crowley says he was OVERSHADOWED and spoke not as himself, remembering nothing [I experienced this summoning Baphomet/333 in a "neural net" in a retarded IOT ritual in Seattle]. He had sense of being protected and was not afraid [also sounds familiar]. 

Neuberg's curses obeyed before he even speaks them.

Neuberg whistles in a magical manner, which disturbs the demon. (He had not done this before.)

333 is terrified by silence and concentration and can be brought to obey by WILLING IN SILENCE.

He loves to argue, and can easily be beaten in argument, but he wins by keeping you distracted.

Neuberg had truck with 333 later, obtaining information from him by long refusing to answer demon's speeches (!) (Use of 333 as information procurer, a la Carroll's Mass of Choronzon?)

**"Choronzon is dispersion; and such is his fear of concentration that he will obey rather than be subjected to it, or even behold it in another."**

There is a supposedly non-extant record of Neuberg that details later dealing with Choronzon (part of Neuberg's ongoing solo A.'.A.'. work presumably).

["The Virgin of Eternity." these are all Virgo expressions, as Babalon is Leo.]

The biblical betulah (בתולה) usually rendered "virgin," is in fact an ambiguous term which in nonlegal contexts may denote an age of life rather than a physical state. Cognate Akkadian batultu (masculine, batūlu) and Ugaritic btlt refer to "an adolescent, nubile, girl." That the woman who is so called need not necessarily be a virgo intacta is shown by the graphic account in a Ugaritic myth of the sexual relations of Baal with the goddess Anath,

39. The first servants are chosen in secret, by my force in her--a captain, a lawyer, an agitator, a rebel--I shall provide. 
40. Call me, my daughter, and I shall come to thee. Thou shalt be full of my force and fire, my passion and power shall surround and inspire thee; my voice in thee shall judge nations.
41. None shall resist thee, whom I lovest. Though they call thee harlot and whore, shameless, false, evil, these words shall be blood in their mouths, and dust thereafter.

New Operation instructions—of 91 days:

1. Prepare chamber. Walls and roof white. Floor, carpet of black&white squares, border blue and gold.

2. If town: No window. If country: Window in roof. Or in temple prepared for passing of Tuat (Cadaveris or Adytum of 2=9 A.'.A.'. initiation).

3. From roof, red glass lamp {sol?}, burning olive oil. Cleanse and make ready after prayer of sunset.

4. Beneath lamp, altar {water?}, 4square, height 3x 1/2 of the breadth, or 3x 2x the breadth. Top is white wood, well 
polished. In center is triangle of oak wood {Geburah} painted scarlet.

5. Upon oak triangle: Hemispherical censer, on three legs, of silver {luna?}, within a hemisphere of copper {venus?}, upon the top a grating of gilded silver {spirit?}. Burn Abramelin incenses {air?}

6. Abramelin oil in crystal flask w/in altar {spirit?}

7. Wear robe of Probationer no matter rank. (Hex shows Nuit/Hadit/RHK—and Adonai is golden Tau in midst of their marriage. {Probationer robe = 5=6 robe})

8. Alternate complex silk robe given.

9. Wand of almond or hazel cut by own hands at Equinox, Solstice, day of Corpus Christi, or a Thelemic feast day.

10. Engrave with own hand upon a gold plate the Holy 12fold Table (or some particular device). 4square w/in circle, winged (Hadit), attached to forehead by blue silk ribbon.

11. Wear fillet of rose, ivy, or rue; burn it in censer every day after prayer of sunset.

12. Pray 3x day—sunset, midnight, sunrise. If able, +4x prayers between sunrise and sunset. Each prayer at least 1 hr. constantly extend and more greatly enflame thyself.

13. Carry out for 11 weeks. 

14. During this time you make an invocation, fully inspired by Crown, and write in letters of gold on top of Altar.

15. Copy invocation on sheet of pure white vellum, with Indian ink, and illuminate it according to fancy and imagination (Yesod/Yetzirah), informed by beauty (Tiphareth).

16. First day of 12th week (sunrise of 78th day): Enter chamber at sunrise. Burn invocation in the lamp. {Repeating from aethyr-calling instructions.} Make prayer.

17. Chamber will be filled with light insufferable for splendor (overcoming Hod), perfume intolerable for sweetness (overcoming Netzach?). 

18. HGA appears. Remain in K&C all day. 

19. Remain in temple for 3 days, sunrise to sunset, and obey counsel and suffer that which is appointed.

20. For 10 days, withdraw fully into meditation, and harmonize the inner world with the Angel. {Total 91 days = AMN = compare 91 hours of each Aethyric operation in Aethyr 18. All 30 aethyrs = 2,730 hours = 113.75 days = 3.79 months, / 30 operations.}

21. Return to world and perfom that which has been appointed. [Traditional Adept instruction-one is being brought to Understand. The Angel itself leads you from Tiphareth to the brink of the Abyss and then hurls you across.]

22. If you continue in K&C, the Angel will at last bring you to City of Pyramids (8=3).

Error to see HGA in gimel. HGA is totally above abyss, in the supernals. Paths that cross abyss to Tiphareth (Gimel, Zayin, Heh) are the servants of Babalon and the Beast (Binah and Chokmah) and the unspoken "others." As servants they have no name (NEMO), but we are of blood royal (cup of babalon?) and serve not, and hence we are less than they (lower numbers/more simplified). with all that they remai themselves, who have eaten pomegranate of hell

[persephone was earlier indentified as Daughter of Babalon.] {Doctrine of black brothers in Liber 333? they remain themselves in Da'ath} This is beyond 8=3 grade.

4-letter word that contains all the mystery of YHVH = TARO as all 78 permutations of YHVH (ADNI spelt in full...?), and conceals a 7-fold word = possibly BABALON, for Malkuth concealeth Binah, and 2 x 78 = 156.

And that again conceals the holy word that is the key of the Abyss: NOX. [Babalon conceals because she is Lady of City of Pyramids beneath Night of Pan.]. [Or ChAOS?]

Crowley: Words are likely TARO, BABALON, ChAOS. <ferens fructum, bearing fruit, A'aVShH PRI = 7 letters and = 671>

[JAE solution: PRKTh. Because it is mingled with YHVH to form PYRHKVThH. = 726 = VITRIOL (also Portal ritual in GD). 

VITRIOL is a notariqon of Journey to the center of the earth [VIT] / by rectification thou shalt find [RI] / the hidden stone [OL]. - hidden truth buried in our inmost center. = VIT, RI, OL. RI = 210, NOX, keyword of Abyss. RI also = Hebrew = rushing water.

Paroketh is traditionally (non-GD) the name of the veil before the Holy of Holies (a receding goal, drawing deeper within us as we progress—so at threshold of Yesod, Tiphareth *and* Supernals). First letter, PEH, unlocks the Gate of Venus literally (!!!).

mortals are closed in sleep, and wherewith he also, at will, re-awakeneth the
sleeper; and terribly &Xi the globe at its summit dart forth rays. Andhe bare a
scroll whereon was written:
Lumen est in Deo,
Lux in hornine factum,
Sive Sol,
Sive Luna,
Sive Stelloc errantes,
Omnia in Lux,
Lux in Lumine
Lumen in Centrum,
Centrum in Circulo,
Circulum ex Nihilo,

Then Hermes cried aloud, and said:
'I am Hermes Mercurius, the Son of God, the messenger uniting Superiors
and Inferiors. I exist not without them, and their union is in me. I
bathe in the Ocean. I fill the expanse of Air. I penetrate the depths beneath."
And the Frater who was with me, said unto me:
"Thus is the Balance of Nature maintained, for this Mercury is the beginning
of all movement. This He, (10) this She, this IT, is in all things, but hath
wings which thou canst not constrain. For when thou sayest 'He is here' he is
not here, for by that time he is already away, for he is Eternal Motion
and Vibration."
Nevertheless in Mercury must thou seek all things. Therefore not without
reason did our Ancient Fratres say that the Great Work was to "Fix the
Volatile." There is but one place where he can be fixed, and that is the Centre,
a centre exact. "Centrum in trigono centri." (11) The Centre in the triangle of
the Centre.
If thine own soul be baseless how wilt thou find a standing point whence
to fix the soul of the Universe?
"Christus de Christi,
Mercury de Mercurio,
Per viam crucis,
Per vitam Lucis
Deus te Adjutabitur!" (12)

(Note: An illustration accompanying this manuscript depicted a conventional
nude figure of Mercury, winged helmet and sandals, diving into
the sea. In the right hand was the Caduceus, and the left bore a scroll showing
the words described in the text.-1.R)

Sam Webster actually turned this into a ritual [here.](http://www.digitalherm.com/invocations-practices/book-m-the-vision-of-the-universal-mercury/)

Whirling swastika throws off all dust of stars and great forgotten gods (Rashith ha-Gilgalim as recycler?), Swastika, Aleph by shape and number. ; in beth = arms of magician = swastika; in gimel = sign of mourning of isis = crown defended by 3 thunderbolts. 3 x 17 = 51, failure and pain - NA and AN]

Shut out by black swastika w corona of fire/

Cursed is he who uncovers nakedness of Most High (IAIDA), because he is drunk on blood of adepts (brought to him by Babalon) = the end of Noah and Shem (Shem-Ham-Mephorasch). Babalon hath lulled him to sleep on her breast, she hath fled away, and left him naked, and called her children together and said let us make a mock of the nakedness of the Most High. [NOH = 64; ChM = 48]

The three schools [Shem, Ham, Japheth]:

1 covers shame with cloth, walking backwards = white
2 covers shame w cloth, walking sideways = yellow
3 made a mock of his nakedness, walking forward, and was black.

[aleph bet gimel?]

Also = 3 magi that journeyed to bethlehem.

But since you're not 9=2 you don't get to know which one prevailed, or if they are not all one school.

[These are discussed in Magick w/o Tears. Black School ≠ Black Brothers or "the School of Black Magick." Representative expressions of White/Yellow/Black: Rosicrucians, Taoists, Buddhists. These schools emanate from the Third Order throughout history. On all being one: JAE says that Crowley later confirmed that they are indeed all one school.]

The Black Brothers do not lift their heads to Chokmah, because they were *drowned in the flood*, Binah, before the true vine could be planted on holy hill of Zion.

[ZION = 156!!!!!!! FACK. Hence Zion = Binah.]

In center, all things whirl by (rashith?)

volatile is fixed (tao). [2=9/9=2] not by stillness but by impurturbability of constant motion ["Go," fifth power of sphinx? Thelema? New Aeon doctrine... go go go in way of true will]

far darting hawk = mercury sign, horns are hawk wings.

Thoth = God of Lies, for speech is two-fold and truth is one [Liber b] he is also solar (see paris working). He is catching flies in his web (Ruach).

**just because you see this on astral (Yetzirah) does not mean you have attained here!** Critical doctrine.

Run and return = Rabbinical QBLH doctrine of word going forth in manifestation and then returning (?). Word=Thoth

You cannot pass Thoth/Ave unless you slay him [Cross of the Frog—lo and behold, it *is* in Liber 418. Again see my 2006 experience.] And then you become him—the great deceiver, maker of Illusions and setter of snares, who baffleth even NEMO. He stands on every path and turns them aside from truth with his words and magick arts. (Mind—*not* 333 but *Thoth himself* [or Ape of Thoth?], Mayan, the great magician)

Reference to "King of the Wood" by Crowley. [From International?] {You have to kill the King to become the king, and to do so means that one day someone will kill you - this was written on Lake Pasaquaney where Crowley sacrificed the frog}

[Crowley writes in his Magus diaries of a revelation—this one?—that is sheer horror, and could force every 8=3 into the Abyss and every 5=6 into the Qliphoth.]

[In 1944, Crowley wrote to Grady McMurtry on the office of OHO of OTO—"My sword to him that can get it," perhaps with this very doctrine in mind. See 'The Unknown God,' p 113]

Crowley (not Aethyr): "Jesus is just a figurehead used by priests for their Great Sorcery."

ALL of the Magi were bound with the Curse of Thoth, and as guardians of truth have taught NOTHING BUT FALSEHOOD., except to those in the City of Pyramids, because **truth cannot pass the Gate of the Abyss**.

However, the lower sephiroth *reflect* the truth (does that mean it is reversed????) balanced in beauty, so those who have sought only Tiphareth have come closest to truth, as it gets 3 paths from supernals, and chesed/geburah only get one.

So if you seek majesty, power, victory, learning, happiness, gold - you will be discomfited (other lower sephira)

Adhere to Beauty. JAE: "It works, so do it."

Since you ate the Pomegranate in hell, you are concealed for half of every year (Crowley spent 1/2 of every year in magical retirement, because he "refused to adopt one of the routine methods of success in Magick. He, being the BEast 666, had to keep hold on Tiphareth by maintaining Formula of Rosy Cross"(?) (IXº OTO?)

Temple like Temple of Vesta at heart of Aethyr—an Urn suspended in air (see Liber 73, The Urn, on Crowley's ultimate initiation to 9=2). above 8 pillars, canopy, circle of marble stones, outer circle of pillars, forest of stars. 

Urn is made of FIXED MERCURY, and within are the ashes of the consumed Book of the Tarot—that is—if you go from 8=3 to 9=2, your Pyramid of Dust is *consumed to ashes*, and this is preserved in the Urn. [Tarot also = 22 letters which in combination open 231 gates of Chokmah known to Qabalists {????} (Liber 231?)]

[Sepher Yetzirah 2:9, Heidrick:

He fixed the twenty-two Letters of foundation on the sphere like a wall with 231 gates, and turned the spheres forward and backward. For an illustration may serve the three letters, Gimel, Nun, Ayin. There is nothing better than joy {spelled  Ayin-Nun-Gimel in Hebrew} and nothing worse than sorrow or plague {spelled  Nun-Gimel-Ayin, in Hebrew. Thus various combinations of the same letters in this language can produce opposite meanings. This is a part of the mysticism of the letters, and also a part of the nature of Hebrew root word formations}]

[Text of Rawn Clark on the 231 gates, which seem to be all possible permutations of the paths taken as initiatory gates?

[231 Gates](https://www.academia.edu/7684332/The_231_Gates_The_231_Gates_of_Initiation_of_Initiation_According_to_the_Hebrew_Tree_The_32_Paths_of_Wisdom_and_the_16_Hidden_Paths)

Tarot as ThARA'a = 671
The Book Tarot = SPR ThARA'a = 1,011 = ThHOM = The Abyss.

Jupiter and Mercury (Kether and Chokmah) inspired Ephesus, City of Diana, Binah, a black stone, and burnt their books of magick:

Acts 14:12King James Version (KJV)

12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.

Acts 19:19King James Version (KJV)

19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.

Center of Infinite Space (Hadit) IS that Urn, and Hadit is the fire that has burned up the Book of Thoth. For the 

**TARO=accumulated wisdom of Old Aeon.**

**And in the Book of Enoch was first given the wisdom of the New Aeon.** And it was hidden for 300 years, because it was wrested untimely from the tree of life by the hand of a desperate magician. [Book of Enoch ≠ Book of Enoch, it means the Enochian transmissions—an early attempt to communicate the Law of Thelema to an un-ready humanity]

[Kelley. Crowley here **directly references** the passage on No Sin from Casaubon—April 18, 1587.]

**Crowley: The Master of that Magician [Luther—in Protestant hierarchy?] overthrew the Christian church, but the pupil overthrew the master, for he saw that the New (Protestant) would be worse than the Old.** But: Luther was actually preparing for the overthrow of the Old Aeon, and his magical act of cohabitating w a nun helped.

On Urn:

[A hidden sigil, perceivable only by a 9=2, hidden by hand]

[JAE: Hand = Yod, 20th path; ∑1-20 = 210, NOX. The veil IS what it veils/ 

NOX {Greek, same as English}

O-X sigil of NOX (Ordeal X?)

Stabat Crux juxta Lucem. Stabat Lux juxta Crucem. ("The Cross shall stand near the Light. The Light shall stand near the cross.")

[Simplex = 230. Initials, SCIL, SLIC = 78, TARO.]

[Section on whether to believe/not Kelley and Crowley. Either you do or don't; both have equally valid truth claims; i.e., none except the beauty, complexity and mathematics of their works. Choice to believe or not... what do both look like? Spell out.]

From the ashes of the Tarot, who shall make Phoenix Wand? (Planets) [6=5 officer]. Because he who from understanding made Lotus Wand (Zodiac) [Tiphareth officer] to grow in Binah cannot even do this.

Lotus Wand: Binah [Lotus=Sea]

Phoenix Wand: Chokmah [Phoenix=Ashes/Rising Anew, etc]

Winged Globe: Kether

Get out-you're not an atheist. You've penetrated mother (Binah) but not slain father (Chokmah) - "Have not burnt up all karma."

Crowley overcoming his personal psychology: He's fucked his mother, but he hasn't slain his adoring projections on his father.

Get back from the Urn, your ashes are not hidden here. (You haven't attained here.)

LXV V:34-40:

Also I was in the spirit vision and beheld a parricidal pomp of atheists, coupled by two and by two in the supernal ecstasy of the stars. They did laugh and rejoice exceedingly, being clad in purple robes and drunken with purple wine, and their whole soul was one purple flower-flame of holiness.

They beheld not God; they beheld not the Image of God; therefore were they arisen to the Palace of the Splendour Ineffable. A sharp sword smote out before them, and the worm Hope writhed in its death-agony under their feet.

Even as their rapture shore asunder the visible Hope, so also the Fear Invisible fled away and was no more.

O ye that are beyond Aormuzdi and Ahrimanes! blessèd are ye unto the ages.

They shaped Doubt as a sickle, and reaped the flowers of Faith for their garlands.

They shaped Ecstasy as a spear, and pierced the ancient dragon that sat upon the stagnant water.

Then the fresh springs were unloosed, that the folk athirst might be at ease.

Shining Pylon, above is the sigil of eye in triangle (S.'.S.'.). light streams through pylon from before face of Isis-Hathor, with lunar crown of cows' horns with disk in center, with child Horus at breast. (Lunar from name) [Chokmah eye]

You don't know how 7=4, much less 8=3. In the word BAPHOMETR, these are made one, and there is the mystery of rending asunder veil of Mother. {BAPHOMETR also = BABALON and Zeus Arrhenothelus [Air?]}

Avenue of pylons carved from mountain—substance harder than diamond, brighter than light, heaver than lead—with ALL of the gods of ALL of the nations of Earth seated in Pylons(!!!) all avenues lead to top of mountain (all roads lead to rome and all paths are true?) [Holy Mountain]

In center is a circle into which 9 pylons open (9 Naths, 9 Great Men). In center is a circular table (similar to Holy Mountain scene). It is supported by 9 marble figures of men and women, alternately white and black, face inwards, their buttocks almost worn away by those who have come to kiss their asses to worship Supreme God, who is the single end of all those religions... but the SHRINE ITSELF is too high for man to reach.

He is lifeted by the Angel. Surrounded by holy men - in right hand of each a weapon, left giving sign of silence. 

The password is: THERE IS NO GOD.

Silver Star suspended, and on forehead of each holy man. (S.'.S.'.) It is a pentagram, because 3+5=8; 3+8=11.

He stands in circle. A weapon is given to him. Password whispered around and all nod until it returns to him.

It doesn't mean they deny god.

*There* is no god. (There slightly emphasized), which possibly means no god in shrine because god is everywhere, or infinitely more or other meanings

AL: 

ii.23. I am alone: there is no God where I am. 

ii.3. In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found.
ii.4. Yet she shall be known & I never. 

Islam: "Allah is the aethist; he has no Allah"

All blotted by angel of Aethyr. black, burnished scale, edge gold, vast wings w claws on ends, like dragon's face, dreadful piercing eyes.

He has imperfectly annihilated himself. These are JUST YOUR THOUGHTS—and as there is NO GOD in the ultimate shrine, there is NO I in thine own cosmos!

Only NEMO can say this, but all have misinterpreted including you (Liber B?)

Something like: True God is equally in all shrines, and true I in all parts of the body and soul {JL there is no part of me that is not of the gods}

roaring, belching forth smoke to fill the aethyr

ALL GREAT RELIGIONS OF ALL WORLDS END HERE, and they are only the smoke of my breath... I am only the head of the Great Dragon that eatheth up the Universe!!!!! Without which 5th aethyr would be perfect, even as the first. you must pass me by. [enter mouth of dragon?]

No more bound: New rule.
1. Purify thyself
2. Be in sunlight, day free from clouds
3. Make the Call of the Aethyr in silence.

Head of Dragon is but tail of Aethyr (see name of Aethyr). People see this fearful aspect of God and turn back. arrow/moon

Arrow of Sun, fledged with plumes of Maat, plumes of Amoun, phallus of Amoun the Concealed One (yoni/phallus - see p. 201) Barb is the silver star from before.

**ARROW = MIDDLE PILLAR.** launched by yesod

He is blessed that is born under sign of arrow [Edward Kelley, who crowley declares 5=6 Adeptus Major, who founded the work. Crowley, of Aeon of Horus, Kelley=Isaiah, and Levi=John the Baptist; diagram of Holy Table giving only name of Saturnian angel STIMCUL {???}, has sigil on his head of crowned lion and body of snake and arrow therewith {cagliostro/crowley... or crowley/achad}

Upward arrow = Yesod YHVH (Yesod is Phallus of IAIDA) and yod a hand;
downward = shot by topmost point of yod, "The HErmit", point not extended, night unto heart of Hadit.

" 6. I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is theknowledge of me the knowledge of death. "

Teh Angel is not actually the angel of Aire - he was but a watcher on threshhold

wingerd light, fountains of fire, mystery of wedge [kundalini phenomena]

golden god-child with two snakes - one red one blue. [Eros holding ida and pingala - sexual nature of kundalini?]

eros = 365. this would link him with Abrasax, Meithras and other solar-phallic dieties - see VIIº OTO and section of Gnostic Mass that mentions Abrasax. Solar-Phallic secret of OTO.

LIFE IS A LONG INITIATION INTO SORROW [Binah]. And Isis is Lady of Sorrow, my mother, Nature; twin sister Nephthys, Perfection. Isis known by all by not Nephthys who is dark and feared.

If you adore w/o fear, make your life an initiation into her Mystery, who has neither mother, father, sister, brother, wife, child—as lonely as hermit crab in waters of the GReat Sea (detachment/vairagya, Liber Cheth)=behold! glory of isis, and at end you commune w nephthys. and then wings of Maut beyond even these. pierce her heart with will - i am eros. slay me or thou shalt not unveil mystery of this aethyr. 

He does so as NEMO (one black & one white arrow), because No man can do this thing. he shoots both him and himself, but he lives and she slain

[JAE: Vision of Arrow = Kundalini rush]

"It beams. It burns. It blooms." Crowley says this is a password of A.'.A.'., but JAE doesn't know what grade or know anything.

Arrow = maat and Thoth crowns

THAT WHICH IS ABOVE IS **NOT** LIKE THAT WHICH IS BELOW (and vice versa)

What is above & what is below? There is division that divideth not, and multiplication that multiplieth not, and the one is the many [an essential mystery of Thelema].

you sought remedy of sorrow; now all sorrow is thy portion - "God hath laid upon him the iniquity of all" thy blood in cup of Babalon ; thy heart the universal heart, bound about with green serpent of delight (heart girt w serpent). heart is that which rejoiceth; serpent of death, for each contain their own opposite. this is the mystery of the supernals. 


[When you commingle your life with the ALL, the all is reciprocal.]

**below abyss = contradiction is division**

**above = contradiction is unity**

nothing true except by virtue of contradiction that is contained in itself. (ye shall know truth by its paradox)

seer's mind = universe. contest between vision and memories (new input and samskaras?) great wind sent forth to banhammer him. you're still an 8=3, dude.
