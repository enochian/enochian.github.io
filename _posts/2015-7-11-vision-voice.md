Assessing Aleister Crowley (Frater O.M.) and Victor Neuberg's (Frater Omnia Vincam) work with the 30 Aethyrs in 1909, Algeria, from November 23 to December 19 of that year. This working elucidated and developed the Book of the Law (1904) and Thelemic Holy Books (1907), particularly *Liber VII*, and firmly established the Thelemic cosmology that would later inform the O.T.O. and Gnostic Mass. Two years later, the recieved book *Liber Cheth* further developed the iconography of BABALON:
<center><h3><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">NOLABAB</p></h3></center>
The Scarlet Woman, who also figures centrally in Revelation, appeared to Dee and Kelley after the wife-swapping incident that ended their partnership, and  appeared to Crowley for the first time in the Algerian sessions. BABALON is not a part of the Golden Dawn Enochian material that Crowley drew on for these sessions, although he may well have read of the Dee and Kelley apparition in the Sloane folios in the British Library(?); Revelation, of course, formed the core of Crowley's psychology as the Bible was his sole reading material during his adolescence in the Plymouth Bretheren, leading him to identify totally with the Beast, the consort of BABALON in Revelation. Crowley thereafter formulated BABALON as the center of his sex-magical or Tantric system, overlaying the Beast/BABALON mythos to the technical sexual magick afforded him only later, in June 1912, upon his admission to the IXº O.T.O. by Theodor Reuss.

Crowley, according to his *Confessions*, had read Casaubon before embarking on his Algerian trip with Neuberg, and had seen Dee and Kelley's scrying implements in the British Museum. Crowley's opinion of Kelley's transmissions is high:

"It is not a jargon; it has a grammar and syntax of its own. It is very much more sonorous, stately and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit, and the English translation, though in places difficult to undersatdn, contains passages of sustained sublimity that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass. To condemn Kelly as a cheating charlatan—the accepted view—is simply stupid. If he invented Enochian, and composed this superb prose, he was at worst a Chatterton with fifty times that poet's ingenuity and five hundred times his poetical genius." – *The Confessions*

##The Aethyrs
<center><img src="http://img44.xooimage.com/files/d/7/0/roue_aethyrs-d1e1f7.jpg"></center>

30 consecutive Aethyrs are outlined by Kelley—they are either "dominion extending in ever widening circles without and beyond the Watchtowers of the Universe," the infinite cube formed by the four tables; or aires simply means "climes" and they pertain to different parts of the world.

##Operating Procedures

Crowley's initial experiments were undertaken by modifying the 19th Call for each Aethyr, and then scrying the Spirit Vision—astral travel or willed imagination—which is outlined in the grade papers of the Golden Dawn. More precise methods, involving prepartory pentagrams and grade signs, are given in his later paper *Liber Chanokh*. None of this is found in Dee and Kelley; they are Golden Dawn methods. 9 years passed between his initial investigation of Aethyrs 30 and 29 and the Algerian experiment; this Crowley attributes to having increased his Grade or spiritual maturity to now be able to handle the visions. This factoring of the observer and their responses to messages, as well as changing information, perhaps, may be applied in reverse to Dee and Kelley. Crowley's line, again from the *Confessions*, is: "Anyone might use the Key for any Aethyr he chose, but he would either get no vision at all or expose himself to deception, and that probably of the deadly dangerous kind."

<center><sub>The desert near Bou Saada</sub></center>

In Bou Saada, Algeria, Crowley employed a "great golden topaz (set in a Calvary cross of six squares, made of wood, painted vermillion) engraved with a Greek cross of five squares charged with the Rose of forty-nine petals." 49 is the number of squares in each Table. (This topaz, I am recalling off the top of my head, was stolen from Sascha Germer by the Solar Lodge in the late 1960s and subsequently lost in a fire at their ranch.) Crowley would scry into this stone physically after reciting the call. This is a marked difference from his earlier "spirit vision" methods; astral travel is essentially willed imagination with eyes closed, while scrying is looking for visuals in a physical object with eyes open. His method at this point was the simply let the Aethyr itself "overshadow" his senses as he drifted into deep trance—bringing the Aethyr to him instead of going to it. Recieved information was later checked by Qabalistic correspondence, Crowley's favored check against self-delusion. For Crowley, if a "spirit" code transmit accurate Qabalistic codes, and in particular if it demonstrated that it knew more Qabalah than him, then his connection to the other side was valid. When dealing with the Otherworlds, this was the equivalent of a Masonic handshake or, as we might say today, a valid password or SSH key. Later magical students, more influenced by pop psychology, like Crowley's once-secretary Israel Regardie, would have explained this by suggesting that Crowley—and, indeed, Kelley—were simply accessing deeper parts of their own brains, portions more advanced than their waking consciousness. [What does modern psychology/neuroscience say about this?]

Dee and Kelley utilized no such tests.

For Crowley, the Enochian visions subsumed *all* prior world religions, mystery cults and esoteric symbolism, all of it ultimately giving way to the incoming Aeon of Horus that had been announced by Aleister and Rose Crowley's 1904 reception of the *Book of the Law* in Cairo. *The Vision of the Voice* far surpasses this book both in length and complexity, and fully elucidates and develops the doctrine of the Aeon, which would inform Crowley's later attempts to formulate Thelema as an organized and terrestrial religion as opposed to something he had seen only while in a visionary state. That the content of Crowley's Enochian visions seem to confirm his own developing philosophy and primacy as a messianic figure immediately makes them suspect, even by Crowley's own standards—writing later, in the "Notes for an Astral Atlas" appendix to *Book 4*, Crowley warns the student that:

"Remember, then, always, but especially when dealing with the Astral Plane, that man's breath stirs the Feather of Truth. What one sees and hears is 'real' in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or created by one's personality... 

"The Magician may go on for a long time being fooled and flattered by the Astrals that he has himself modified or manufactured. Their natural subservience to himself will please him, poor ape!

"They will pretend to show him marvellous mysteries, pageants of beauty and wonder unspeakably splendid; he will incline to accept them as true, for the very reason that they are images of himself idealized by the imagination.

"But his real progress will stop dead. These phantasms will prevent him from coming into contact with independent intelligences, from whom alone he can learn anything new.

"He will become increasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to be attaining one initiation after another. His Ego will expand unchecked, till he seem to himself to have heaven at his feet. Yet all this will be nothing but his fool's face of Narcissus smirking up from the pool that will drown him." [(via)](http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/app3.html)

In many ways, *The Vision and the Voice* marks the high point of Crowley's career as an Adept—now a Magister Templi—of the Golden Dawn system outlined by his mentor Mathers. Post-Algeria, Crowley would be wrapped up in the drama of a new mystery school—the Ordo Templi Orientis or OTO—and concern himself largely with its sexual methods and with instituting Thelema as a religion, with himself as the head. His research progressed along other lines, and administrative manners; however, Crowley the Pure Seeker was never quite so pristine, to be replaced with Crowley the PR Man for the Aeon.

Additionally, Crowley used a Muslim mantra, from Surah 112, while travelling across the desert—this being done to enter receptive mental states, or "purify" himself as he put it, by creating states of absolute physical exhaustion so that his body would not disturb his mind, much like the use of *asana* in Hatha Yoga:

*Qul: Huw-Allahu ahad; Allahu samad; lam yalid wa lam yulad; wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad.* 

This was recited 1,001 times per day, with each recitation followed by a prostration. (1,001 is obviously taken from *1,001 Nights*, translated by Crowley's early hero and role model Richard Burton; it is used in this book to denote an infinitely large number, much as the number 10,000 is used in Buddhist texts. The number is indeed important in Sufism; students of the [Mevlevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevlevi_Order) dervish order must undergo 1,001 days of prayer before becoming a teacher.)

Crowley was now able to penetrate beyond the initial two aethyrs; his progress beyond the 19th was assisted by a specially appointed Angelic guardian; the following aethyrs concerned the equilibriation and then destruction of Crowley's individual self. By the 14th Aethyr, Crowley and Neuberg has climbed the mountain Daleh Addin—this mountain is now called Djebel Chélia or simply Chélia; it was here that Crowley began to have Victor Neuberg sodomize him, as an effort in taboo-breaking and disruption of the personality—Crowley writes (circuitiously, as sodomy was still illegal, a major reason for Crowley's often obfuscatory writing and personal legal troubles) that "I may say that the essence of the matter was that I had hitherto clung to certain conceptions of conduct which, while perfectly proper from the standpoint of my human nature, were impertinent to initiation." This may have assisted visionary states; it may also have been a deep working out of Crowley's own conflict around his sexuality. While homosexuality was not new for him, passive sodomy may have been. This sexual taboo-breaking also occurs in Madimi's request that Dee and Kelley swap wives, perhaps as a way of deeply disrupting the personality in order to open it to further visionary input. As Dee and Kelley eventually did, Crowley writes that he "obeyed my Angel," and turned passive sodomy [was it actually this?] into a means of invoking his Holy Guardian Angel. He would later write in the comfort of his own intellect and literary anonymity in the *Bagh-i-Muattar*, where he becomes much more confident and bombastic. Crowley glyphed this act in later writings as "XIº OTO"—homosexual sex magick—although at the time he had not yet been initiated to OTO.

<center><sub>Djebel Chélia as it appears today.</sub></center>

These acts, he wrote, disrupted his personality and undermined his ego totally—he was in a state of psychosis or mania, perhaps. Crowley was now to enter the "City of Pyramids," a landscape informed by the Enochian tablets or rather the Golden Dawn conceit of turning their squares into pyramids, this being the habitation of Masters or non-physical adepts, and given to the task of the Master of the Temple in raising up humanity, in Crowley's case under the planetary aegis of Jupiter or the sphere Chesed. The Queen of the City of Pyramids was now revealed to be BABALON herself, who accepted the blood of the saints here encamped, and to whom they were enjoined to offer their ego totally, under penalty of imperfect initiation and stagnation; similary to Dee and Kelley's account of the "Daughter of Fortitude," BABALON's appearance followed the successful accomplishment of the breaking of sexual taboo.

Now being "abandoned" by his angelic guardian, Crowley was told to call the 10th Aethyr, ZAX, and cross the "Abyss" or separation between God and man, noumenon and phenomenon, the guardian of which was CHORONZON, the "mighty devil" [c] described by Kelley. Crowley was here taking the name "Coronzon" from Casaubon and changing the spelling to Choronzon, potentially so that were the name transliterated into Hebrew, the first letter would be Cheth, "Ch." Crowley's Hebrew transliteration, given in *Sepher Sephiroth*, is ChVRVNZVN, Cheth-Vau-Resh-Vau-Nun-Zayin-Vau-Nun, enumerating to 333 by Gematria.

However, this spelling is one of several things that Casaubon got wrong; Dee's diaries themselves identify this entity as "Coronzom," and this has been corrected in Stephen Skinner's revision of Casaubon. In Enochian letters, this would be:

<center><h2><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">MOZNOROC</p></h2></center>

[**NOTE:** This Enochian web font, designed in 1996, is inaccurate. It uses the same character (Don) for Don (R) and Tal (M), a common beginner mistake; they are different characters. See the Enochian alphabet below. This means the final Tal or M is not correct, this would unfortunately have to be done by hand. Then again, maybe it's best not to put a demon's name online.]

<center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Enochian_alphabet.png/550px-Enochian_alphabet.png"></center>

This demon—representing the final chaos of the mind—was evoked into a triangle using the medium of pigeon blood (three pigeons were sacrificed), in operating procedures taken from the *Göetia* or *Lesser Key of Solomon*—Kelley had been rebuked by the Angels for his prior work with Göetia. Neuberg worked as the operator while Crowley himself stood in the triangle, perhaps hoping Neuberg would "exorcise" the Choronzom complex from him totally. Crowley was possessed, broke the circle and attacked Neuberg; Neuberg banished the demon back to the triangle by vibrating the Qabalistic names of God and striking Crowley with his magical dagger. The demon returned to the triangle where it continued to psychologically attack Neuberg until the "energy" in the spilled pigeon blood was depleted. Crowley wrote the name of BABALON in the sand with his ring, and emerged from his possession trance. The ordeal lasted two hours.

Beyond ZAX, the character of the Aethyrs changed. Crowley notes that the original text of the 19th Call reads, at face value, as curse:

"O YE Heavens which dwell in the first Air, yea are mighty in the parts of the Earth, and execute the Judgment of the Highest! Unto you it is said: Behold the Face of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of the Heavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth, and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding to dispose all things according to the Providence of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, and rose up in the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be governed by her parts, and let there be Division in her, that the glory of her may be always drunken, and vexed in itself. Her course, let it run with the Heavens; and as an handmaid let her serve them. One season, let it confound another, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her members, let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one Creature equal with another. The reasonable Creatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling-places, let them forget their Names. The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His buildings, let them become Caves for the beasts of the Field! Confound her understanding with darkness! For why? it repenteth me that I have made Man. One while let her be known, and another while a stranger: because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that is fallen."

In the 9th Aethyr and beyond, and Coronzom overcome, the text appeared to Crowley as a blessing, showing that is only the mind of man which projects evil and disorder upon the pristine perfection of the Universe and, that mind being overcome, there was now nothing but perfection to see. [Elizabethan conception of chaos.] Without an ego, there was now nothing to suffer, and nothing to make suffer. It was years, however, before Crowley could fully assimilate this perspective. As anybody who has tasted heaven through spirtual practice or drugs can tell you, there's always a comedown, and always a morning after. But once you've seen freedom, you can't forget that it exists, and you can begin the work of slowly retraining a lifetime of bad thinking and false perception—*samskaras*, as Hindu meditators would say—to fall in line with the new perspective.

The remaining Aethyrs showed progressive visions of purity and grace, until the sequence ended. (My own experiences with the 30 Aethyrs, repeated in haphazard fashion in 2006 with a group of 7 individuals, can be found in *Ultraculture Journal.*)

##Summary of Method

Here, then, is a summary of the methods used by O.M. and Omnia Vincam:

1. Sensory deprivation and social isolation by remaining in uninhabited desert conditions.
2. Physical exhaustion from crossing desert while making 1,001 prostrations per day.
3. Mental focus and emptiness by making 1,001 recitations of Surah 112 per day.
4. The recitation of the 19th Call, modified for each Aethyr.
5. Physically scrying into a golden topaz, while overshadowed by the Aethyr.
6. Taboo-breaking by homosexual sex magick (passive sodomy).
7. Göetic-style evocation AND invocation with aid of animal sacrifice for material basis.

Methods 1-3 would have formed a powerful separation from anything but the ritual psychotheater generated by methods 4-7; such devices are well known by cults the world over as ways of isolating individuals and removing them from anything but the world view of the cult. While here the cult consisted of only two individuals and the methods self-applied, the techniques are consistent. Within such conditions, and within a shared private universe, Crowley and Neuberg—like Dee and Kelley before them—were able to enter a kind of "virtual reality" generated by their unfettered minds, emerging with one of the most striking literary and religious works, in my opinion, of the 20th century. The prose of *The Vision and the Voice* is the best of Crowley's career, surpassing even the Holy Books; like Kelley's messages from the Angels, it is at once exquisitely sacred and profoundly chilling. Next to Dee and Kelley's own Spirit Diaries, it is the primary document of Enochian magick in practice—while Dee and Kelley received the system, Crowley and Neuberg actually *used* it—or at least used a section of it, namely the 30 Aethyrs, rather than the Holy Table itself (Crowley would use the Tablets in later workings, particularly in combination with the VIIIº OTO or masturbatory sex magick). For this reason, *The Vision and the Voice*, or *Liber 418* as it is technically designated in Crowley's A∴A∴, should be studied alongside Dee and Kelley's work.

Following are analyses of each Aethyr. I will here be referring to the following texts:

Crowley, Aleister, with Victor B. Neuberg and Mary Desti. *The Vision & The Voice, With Commentary and Other Papers. (The Equinox, Vol. IV, No. II).* York Beach: Weiser, 1998.

The 30th Aethyr. TEX— "The Exordium of the Equinox of the Gods." Caput Draconis / Virgo / Earth. [Malkuth, Yesod, Hod and Netzach in Malkuth. Also Hod and Netzach on the Tree. I am quite confused by these attributions in Equinox 4.2.]

Comment: Without the cube—the material world—is the sphere-system of the spiritual world enfolding it. The Cry seems to be a sort of Exordium, an external shewing-forth of the coming of the new Aeon, the Aeon of Horus the crowned child.

Crystal cube in form of Harpocrates, surrounded by sphere—"I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. 'Come unto me' is a foolish word: for it is I that go'"—surrounded by four archangels. Suggests Pentagram ritual.

New Aeon comes in at Four Quarters, in each of which an Archangel holds a book labelled back and front in Enochian. [Note: The M's are fucked in the font.] The Archangels are in black robes, their wings and armor lined out in white. All this symbolism seems to elaborate the Pentagram Ritual.
