Assessing Aleister Crowley (Frater O.M.) and Victor Neuberg's (Frater Omnia Vincam) work with the 30 Aethyrs in 1909, Algeria, from November 23 to December 19 of that year. This working elucidated and developed the Book of the Law (1904) and Thelemic Holy Books (1907), particularly *Liber VII*, and firmly established the Thelemic cosmology that would later inform the O.T.O. and Gnostic Mass. Two years later, the recieved book *Liber Cheth* further developed the iconography of BABALON:

The Scarlet Woman, who also figures centrally in Revelation, appeared to Dee and Kelley after the wife-swapping incident that ended their partnership, and  appeared to Crowley for the first time in the Algerian sessions. BABALON is not a part of the Golden Dawn Enochian material that Crowley drew on for these sessions, although he may well have read of the Dee and Kelley apparition in the Sloane folios in the British Library(?); Revelation, of course, formed the core of Crowley's psychology as the Bible was his sole reading material during his adolescence in the Plymouth Bretheren, leading him to identify totally with the Beast, the consort of BABALON in Revelation. Crowley thereafter formulated BABALON as the center of his sex-magical or Tantric system, overlaying the Beast/BABALON mythos to the technical sexual magick afforded him only later, in June 1912, upon his admission to the IXº O.T.O. by Theodor Reuss. Crowley, according to his *Confessions*, had read Casaubon before embarking on his Algerian trip with Neuberg, and had seen Dee and Kelley's scrying implements in the British Museum. Crowley's opinion of Kelley's transmissions is high:

"It is not a jargon; it has a grammar and syntax of its own. It is very much more sonorous, stately and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit, and the English translation, though in places difficult to undersatdn, contains passages of sustained sublimity that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass. To condemn Kelly as a cheating charlatan—the accepted view—is simply stupid. If he invented Enochian, and composed this superb prose, he was at worst a Chatterton with fifty times that poet's ingenuity and five hundred times his poetical genius." – *The Confessions*

##The Aethyrs

30 consecutive Aethyrs are outlined by Kelley—they are either "dominion extending in ever widening circles without and beyond the Watchtowers of the Universe," the infinite cube formed by the four tables; or aires simply means "climes" and they pertain to different parts of the world.

##Operating Procedures

Crowley's initial experiments were undertaken by modifying the 19th Call for each Aethyr, and then scrying the Spirit Vision—astral travel or willed imagination—which is outlined in the grade papers of the Golden Dawn. More precise methods, involving prepartory pentagrams and grade signs, are given in his later paper *Liber Chanokh*. None of this is found in Dee and Kelley; they are Golden Dawn methods. 9 years passed between his initial investigation of Aethyrs 30 and 29 and the Algerian experiment; this Crowley attributes to having increased his Grade or spiritual maturity to now be able to handle the visions. This factoring of the observer and their responses to messages, as well as changing information, perhaps, may be applied in reverse to Dee and Kelley. Crowley's line, again from the *Confessions*, is: "Anyone might use the Key for any Aethyr he chose, but he would either get no vision at all or expose himself to deception, and that probably of the deadly dangerous kind."

In Algeria, Crowley employed a "great golden topaz (set in a Calvary cross of six squares, made of wood, painted vermillion) engraved with a Greek cross of five squares charged with the Rose of forty-nine petals." 49 is the number of squares in each Table. (This topaz, I am recalling off the top of my head, was stolen from Sascha Germer by the Solar Lodge in the late 1960s and subsequently lost in a fire at their ranch.) Crowley would scry into this stone physically after reciting the call. This is a marked difference from his earlier "spirit vision" methods; astral travel is essentially willed imagination with eyes closed, while scrying is looking for visuals in a physical object with eyes open. His method at this point was the simply let the Aethyr itself "overshadow" his senses as he drifted into deep trance—bringing the Aethyr to him instead of going to it. Recieved information was later checked by Qabalistic correspondence, Crowley's favored check against self-delusion. For Crowley, if a "spirit" code transmit accurate Qabalistic codes, and in particular if it demonstrated that it knew more Qabalah than him, then his connection to the other side was valid. When dealing with the Otherworlds, this was the equivalent of a Masonic handshake or, as we might say today, a valid password or SSH key. Later magical students, more influenced by pop psychology, like Crowley's once-secretary Israel Regardie, would have explained this by suggesting that Crowley—and, indeed, Kelley—were simply accessing deeper parts of their own brains, portions more advanced than their waking consciousness. [What does modern psychology/neuroscience say about this?]

Dee and Kelley utilized no such tests.

For Crowley, the Enochian visions subsumed *all* prior world religions, mystery cults and esoteric symbolism, all of it ultimately giving way to the incoming Aeon of Horus that had been announced by Aleister and Rose Crowley's 1904 reception of the *Book of the Law* in Cairo. *The Vision of the Voice* far surpasses this book both in length and complexity, and fully elucidates and develops the doctrine of the Aeon, which would inform Crowley's later attempts to formulate Thelema as an organized and terrestrial religion as opposed to something he had seen only while in a visionary state. That the content of Crowley's Enochian visions seem to confirm his own developing philosophy and primacy as a messianic figure immediately makes them suspect, even by Crowley's own standards—writing later, in the "Notes for an Astral Atlas" appendix to *Book 4*, Crowley warns the student that:

"Remember, then, always, but especially when dealing with the Astral Plane, that man's breath stirs the Feather of Truth. What one sees and hears is 'real' in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or created by one's personality... 

"The Magician may go on for a long time being fooled and flattered by the Astrals that he has himself modified or manufactured. Their natural subservience to himself will please him, poor ape!

"They will pretend to show him marvellous mysteries, pageants of beauty and wonder unspeakably splendid; he will incline to accept them as true, for the very reason that they are images of himself idealized by the imagination.

"But his real progress will stop dead. These phantasms will prevent him from coming into contact with independent intelligences, from whom alone he can learn anything new.

"He will become increasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to be attaining one initiation after another. His Ego will expand unchecked, till he seem to himself to have heaven at his feet. Yet all this will be nothing but his fool's face of Narcissus smirking up from the pool that will drown him." [(via)](http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/app3.html)

In many ways, *The Vision and the Voice* marks the high point of Crowley's career as an Adept—now a Magister Templi—of the Golden Dawn system outlined by his mentor Mathers. Post-Algeria, Crowley would be wrapped up in the drama of a new mystery school—the Ordo Templi Orientis or OTO—and concern himself largely with its sexual methods and with instituting Thelema as a religion, with himself as the head. His research progressed along other lines, and administrative manners; however, Crowley the Pure Seeker was never quite so pristine, to be replaced with Crowley the PR Man for the Aeon.

Additionally, Crowley used a Muslim mantra, from Surah 112, while travelling across the desert—this being done to enter receptive mental states, or "purify" himself as he put it, by creating states of absolute physical exhaustion so that his body would not disturb his mind, much like the use of *asana* in Hatha Yoga:

*Qul: Huw-Allahu ahad; Allahu samad; lam yalid wa lam yulad; wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad.* 

This was recited 1,001 times per day, with each recitation followed by a prostration. (1,001 is obviously taken from *1,001 Nights*, translated by Crowley's early hero and role model Richard Burton; it is used in this book to denote an infinitely large number, much as the number 10,000 is used in Buddhist texts. The number is indeed important in Sufism; students of the [Mevlevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevlevi_Order) dervish order must undergo 1,001 days of prayer before becoming a teacher.)

Crowley was now able to penetrate beyond the initial two aethyrs; his progress beyond the 19th was assisted by a specially appointed Angelic guardian; the following aethyrs concerned the equilibriation and then destruction of Crowley's individual self. By the 14th Aethyr, Crowley and Neuberg has climbed the mountain Daleh Addin—this mountain is now called Djebel Chélia or simply Chélia.
