**LIber Secundus** pertains completely to the reception of the Sigillum Dei {110} Aemaeth {49!} = {159 - is there a way to spell so it = 156? Or is 9 simply the inversion of 6?}, the seven-fold seal that forms the basis of the Enochian furniture.

An earlier version of the Sigillum Dei appears in **Liber iuratus**, a 13th or 14th century grimoire colloquially referred to as the "Sworn Booke," spuriously attributed to Honorious, the son of Euclid. As Euclid died three centuries before the birth of Christ, such an authorial attribution boggles the mind until we remember that Medieval writers often attributed their works to historical personages as a way not only to associate their works with a known stream of thought, and claim prestige thereby, but also as a way of preserving anonymity in a hostile religious climate. The vast number of Hermetic works attributed to "Hermes Trismegistus" are a perfect example of this authorial tradition. A more recent example would be the collective use of the name ["Luther Blissett"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Blissett_(nom_de_plume)) by European leftist activists in the 1990s.

The **Liber iuratus** version of the seal is made by constructing "first a circle whose diameter is three fingers, because of the three cross-nails of the Lord, or five fingers because of the five wounds of Christ, or seven for the seven sacraments, or nine for the nine orders of angels, but usually five fingers will suffice. Then make a second within this circle, let it be a distance from the first two grains because of the two Tablets of the Law of Moses, or three grains because of the persons of the Trinity" ([here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigillum_Dei)). [Note that this version also centers on the word EL - Al - Liber Al.]

One of the oldest European grimoires, the Sworn Book is allegedly the condensation of knowledge produced at a conference of operative magicians, and contains 93 chapters—93 being a number of immense importance to Aleister Crowley's Thelema as enumerating to both "Thelema" (will) and "Agape" (love) in Greek gematria, and therefore forming a mathematical signature of his formula of "Love under Will." Present-day Thelemites greet each other with the salutation "93" and speak of the socio-magical milieu surrounding Crowley's system as the "93 Current." The chapters cover the range of classical magical techniques, from finding treasure to conjuring demons. Like many medieval grimoires (which it perhaps formed the key influence for), the Sworn Book purports to be a manual of summoning "perverse Spirits of Darkness," and therefore demands ritual purity and Christian piety as prerequisites for use. This method of operation—long theurgic preparation before goetic conjuration—forms the basic magic theory of medieval European magic. Though Dee and Kelley [c/a] did not attempt goetic conjuration during their sessions, they followed the same protocol; copies of Dee's pre-session prayers to Jesus—his "Fundamental Obeisance" and others—remain extant. The approach remains consistent even into the 20th century, albeit in the more modern form of Crowley's insistence on attaining to the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (the theurgic Magnum Opus par excellance) before attempting other works of magic. The approach breaks down only with the chaos magick insistence on the non-reality of gods and spirits as anything other than constructions of human belief; outside of this postmodern approach, there is little shift in magical procedures throughout the second Millennium.

Like the Dee manuscripts, the Sworn Book was part of the initial Sloane materials that formed the basis of the British Library. One version thereof—Sloane MS 313—is directly from the library of John Dee, and contains notes in his handwriting ([here](http://www.esotericarchives.com/juratus/juratus.htm)). 

(Peterson: "John Dee, in his Mystical Experiments, was originally told to use a version found in one of his books. Dee consulted several sources, and consulted the angels to resolve the discrepancies. This prompted them to detail an almost totally new version of the Sigillum Dei. One of Dee's sources was apparently Sl.313. Roberts and Watson, in their 1990 John Dee's Library Catalogue, pg. 168, identify Sloane 313 as being one of Dee's manuscripts. They give it catalog number DM70, and note, "On fol.9 (originally the first leaf, fol.1-8 having been misbound) is [Dee's ladder symbol] and, very faint, 'Fragmentum Magicum', which may be in Dee's hand. At the foot is 'Sum Ben: Jonsonij liber'."")

[This begs more research - I believe it is mentioned later by the spirits.]

The seal would re-appear in the 20th century as the seal of Aleister Crowley's A.'.A.'., where it is explicitly connected with the goddess BABALON, who appears at the very end of the Spirit Diaries. Both BABALON and the Seal make repeated appearances in *The Vision and the Voice*.

### On Astrology

James A. Eshelman's use of astrology to refine the analysis of Enochian visions, as shown in *Visions & Voices*, is immensely useful in winnowing out "ambient" astral information from the content of the visions themselves. While we have imprecise times and dates for the workings, we may be able to reconstruct some of this approach to Dee and Kelley's sessions.

As far as dates: Elias Ashmole on dates of “2nd Book” (is this Secundus or a section of Secundus)? states: Between March 21 - April 28 1582, records are wanting. Michael angry Dee has been slack on the 28th. Ashmole suggests that actions were on March 21 and April 28, and between them not much happened—some kind of falling out between Dee and Kelley which was reconciled.  

Location: Mortlake is located at 51n28, 0w16

Charts with approximated times will be included with each action. These are imprecise as we don't have the right time ranges. Where available, times will be guessed from the records (i.e. in Action Six, the Dee and Kelley ask the angels if they can leave for dinner at a certain point).

Charts will be drawn using Sidereal astrology (Fagan/Bradley calculation), for the simple reason that Tropical is not accurate.

### On Angelic Cryptography

The forty characters are obviously cryptography. The question is: What's the code? Each white creature gives some variation on a letter/number combination—Roman letters, although Dee later annotated *Secundus* to suggest that these letters be changed to Enochian characters. The following codes *may* be successfully applied (if we work backwards from *The Vision and the Voice*):

- Transliterations of Latin words into English words into Enochian words (using Laycock) and adding Hebrew Qabalistic analysis. 

[For instance: An angel in Action Six states "Regnabit Iniquitas pro tempore." = "Wickedness will rule for a time." In Enochian, wickedness = BABALON. Time = CAPIMAO; Rule = BOGPA, SONF. Babalon bogpa capimao. (Or thereabouts.) The key, however, is that in Qabalah, Time = Saturn, and Saturn = Binah, the sphere of Babalon, who is the Queen of the City of the Pyramids (Binah). So literally "Regnabit Iniquitas pro tempore" = "Wickedness will rule for a time" may = "Babalon reigns in the City of Pyramids."]
 
- Associations of the colors, functions and actions of the angels to Qabalah
- Hebrew Qabalah and Gematria, in comparison with:
- Enochian Gematria
- Latin Qabalah Simplex
- Astrological data.
- Comparison with the rest of the Dee material.
- Comparison with Elizabethan cryptography techniques in general. (Walsingham.)

## Sixth Action (March 1582)—"40 White Creatures of Sigillum Dei"

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9LB2u4D.gif"></center>

*Dramatis Personae.* Dee, Kelley, Michael, Uriel, Semiel, and the 40 White Creatures.

(Titles in quotes are mine.) This action contains missing pages. 

Michael (Fortitudio Dei) appears, along with Uriel (who is clearly subservient to Michael in their social interactions); he later calls Semeliel (Dee note—"this etymology as though he were the secretary for the Name of God") as a subservient angel. He tells the two that nothing is cut from the Church of God, and that the two are blessed among the Saints. But that Kelley will be separated from temptation.

Angels will separate Dee & Kelley from the impure. Kelley has committed idolatry, but they will right him. 

The seal is now revealed—the "true Circle of his eternity comprehending all virtue."

The forty white creatures appeared one by one, announcing the characters around the Sigillum Dei Aemeth. They all appeared as children, in long, white silk robes.

Michael appeared over all of them, became giant with two legs like pillars of brass, and drew a sword of fire over all 40 of their heads. This caused an earthquake, and they all fell to their knees; Michael now called the angel Semiael to explain the Great Seal. Uriel also fell to his knees before the might of Michael's sword; as Michael swung his flaming sword, flaming fire like lightning also flashed "with all" of the forty white creatures. 

Each of the forty White Creatures steps forward in turn, kneeling and unveiling a number/letter combination on their breast.

Latin Qabalah Simplex values of phrases are listed in {} brackets after Latin phrases. LQS is, I believe, a creation of James A. Eshelman and is simply a matter of assigning numerical values in sequence to the Roman alphabet (i.e. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on to end of sequence). Values ere here calculated using [Gerard del Campo's gematria program.](http://test.thelemistas.org/en/Tools/gematria?system=LatinSimplex) I believe there is a Latin Qabalah Simplex basic Sepher 500 published in *Black Pearl* but we so far have not tabulated these values to any other phrases, this remains for future work.

**Note:** In most depictions of Dee's Sigillum, the letters are listed in English. In the footnotes of Liber Secundus Dee stipulates that some of these letters are in Enochian. However it is not clear if all of these letters were given in Enochian, as some (see 4/T) have specific designs that are neither English or Enochian, and yet others are given in "Roman" letters. It seems that here a purist Enochian magician would do well to re-construct the Sigillum from each entry in *Liber Secundus*. 

Translations to 18/o are from Google Translate; past that are Joseph Peterson's. 

**4/T [Gisg].** Gold character in silk-covered breast. (The T is a specific design, see th book.) 40: "It liveth and multiplieth forever: Blessed be his name." Michael: "Place that in first place. It is the name of the Lord." Vanishes in fire.

Tu es primus O Halleluyah. {556} Angels, one at thy name they shall fall down, O Lord. You are the first O Halleluyah.

**18/o [Med].** Steps forth like water running round about him: "O benedictum Nomen tuum Domine. Numerus perijt cum illis." {533} (Oh, blessed be the name of thy Lord .

Vobis est Mysterium hoc, posterius reuelandum. {481} ("A mystery to be revealed to us.")(Peterson: "A mystery is to be revealed to you afterward." Does this mean the coming of the Aeon of Horus, Vision/Voice sessions and the coming of the Beast Therion?) Fire consumes him and his chair away suddenly.

He blesses with sword, Uriel follows him (Uriel has not appeared during these visions).

After dinner Kelley retires to prayer. Uriel appears and says something's off in the seal.
Some dodginess w Kelley.
M: Veritas est sola in DEO. Et haec omnia vera sunt. {402} Michael says Dee ommitted nothing, but Kelley forgot to tell you some stuff.

Shewer, white man, plucks out trumpet. He again does not blow. At end of trumpet appears a lower-case omega (i.e., one of—the last?—trumpets of Apocalypse?) [Greek Qabalah value: 800]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_trumpets

"In Christian Eschatology, the first six trumpets are used to serve as a wake up call to the sinners on Earth and a call to repentance. Each trumpet blast brings with it a plague of a more disastrous nature than the one before it. The trumpet is used to build anticipation and tells the reader that an alert, announcement, or warning is about to take place. The seventh trumpet does not bring a plague with it. Rather, it is sounded so that glory is given to God and His kingdom is announced."

Christians who follow the Posttribulation rapture doctrine, argue that the seventh trumpet is the last trumpet mentioned in I Corinthians 15:52,[21] and that there is a strong correlation between the events mentioned in Isaiah 27:13,[22] Matthew 24:29-31,[23] and I Thessalonians 4:16.[24] These parallels are used to support the doctrine of the rapture occurring after the tribulation. Therefore, Posttribulationists see the rapture happening during the seventh trumpet. The nature of the 7th trumpet shows that "time is no more, and that the mystery of God is finished, Rev. 10:6,7. At the 7th trumpet, Jesus rules and reigns forevermore,[25] He has taken His great power and reigned,[26] and He rewards the righteous, and judges the wicked.[27] Both Jesus and Paul declare that when Jesus comes, His reward is with Him, and He rewards everyone according to their works, Rev. 22:12,2 Tim 4:1.

Of the three 6 <sup>6</sup> 6 noted, he puts out two lowermost w finer, says: Iste est numerus suus. {260} {This is his number}  

Mist and horrible thunder arise. M puts his finger into trumpet and pulls out a gold plate with a round plate of gold in it, whereon is the figure "i" [but not Gon? drawn as Roman i] with many circles about. He says: Omnia unum es {129} Everything is one. Semeliel vanishes. 

Michael sits in chair, legs gone. 

Laudate Dominium in Sanctus eius {304} Praise the lord in his sanctuary


Circumference, which is done, has 7 names. 7 names contain 7 angels. Every letter contain 7 angels. The numbers are applied to the letters. When you know the 7 names, you will understand the 7 angels. 

Michael on decrypting the circumference: Start with 4 (over T) and read to the right—taking number for the next slot with letter to be read etc...

[Duquette: Count clockwise when the number in the cell is positioned above the letter; count counterclockwise when the letter is positioned above the number.

You read until you hit a letter block with no number. So the first one would be:

thAaoth

[Note: Aa seems to suggest Hebrew. Heb. would be:

ThA'aoTh - Tau Ayin Vau Tau - Earth Capricorn Taurus Earth - all Earth signs. Heb: 876. (Nothing by Lib 500)

It also, of course, seems to be the name Thoth.

Dee does this. However, Michael says: Nope, wrong. You'll understand in the next call. 

## Action Eight (Later, same day)—More instruction, promise of *Soyga*

M: Double letters are double numbers, being the Name of God. (Specifically Aa: So Heb was perhaps wrong.) So when you double letters up, combine. ThAOTh

Dee mentions the 42-letter name of God:

<center><img src=http://cdn1.kabbalah.com/wisdom/AnabKoach.png></center>

Dee explains this as Latin: Pater Deus, Filius Deus, spiritus sanctus Deus: Tres in uno, et unus in tribus. Vel Trinitas in unitate et unitas in Trinitate. {1241} (Trinitarian Creed etc.)

Pater Deus, Filius Deus, et Spiritus Sanctus, Deus, attamen non tres Dij sed unus Deus. {807}

Sicut anima rationalis, et caro, homo unus, ita Deus et homo Messias unus. {659} (As the rational mind and flesh of a person are one, so too are God and man one messiah.) [Ruach + Nephesch = 1 [Serpent?]; Deus + Homo = Messiah (357)]

(Some calculations relating the 40 numbers outwith with the 42 letter name of God, which is there in potential but not actuality...?)

42-letter name is Ana B'Koach—7 names of 6 letters each, for 7 planets/days of the week.

"Satan" in QBLH being the force of division - dividing things.

Out of this circle no creature shall pass, that entereth, if he be made upon the Earth.
This circle created all beasts etc of Earth, as will be revealed in Adam's Treatise From Paradise (Liber Soyga).
Alpha and Omega:
Primus et Nouissimus; unus solus Deus viuit nunc et semper: Hic est, et hic erit: Et hic, sunt Nomina sua Diuina. {1060} (First and newest, one alone God lives now and ever: He is and he will be, and here are his Divine Names. I have spoken."

Benedicamus Dominum. {167} (Let us bless the Lord)

Blessed are those whose portion is not with the wicked.
Wicked = BABALON.
portion not with wicked = who have given all, not just a portion (speck of dust) to Babalon?

## Action Nine—March 20, 1582, 10:00:00

<center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TH1Ge6b.gif></center>

Dee makes, corrects and uses new prayers. Uriel appears with thanks and says they can't appear now, but will come at noon. [Note: Gemini is ascendant, perhaps suggesting that communication will be unclear?]

Dee: Fiat voluntas Dei. {161}

## Skipped Action—March 20, 1582, 12:00:00

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eih7mo5.gif"></center>

This is the time Uriel requested Dee and Kelley to call him at—Kelley drops the ball and they don't get it together until 2 PM. Of course, the only sign that has changed is the Ascendant—the horizon line—from Gemini to Cancer. Note that the ascendant changes every two hours—specifically suggesting that Uriel was waiting out Gemini, as he tells Dee to try again in two hours. Gemini tends to have an association with duplicitous or two-faced communication, perhaps suggesting Uriel either wanted clear lines or wanted to make sure *Dee and Kelley* were communicating properly, or even that the magic-as-communication itself worked properly. Interesting stuff.

## Action Ten—March 20, 1582, 14:00:00

<center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MdtuQFg.gif></center>

[Ascendant still in Cancer, but about to click over into Leo]

Michael and Uriel appear immediately in stone (as if waiting?) M goes and returns with another angel on his right shoulder, carrying 7 little white baskets of gold. M wants the doors shut. 7 baskets hung round canopy of beaten gold. 

Ecce, Mysterium est. Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel. {465} (Behold, it is a mystery. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel. Psalm 7:18)

Canopy stretched to cover all the world (world, heaven, earth in stone) so heaven can be seen. Baskets hang in border of horizon [Note the Ascendant, horizon calculations; also Horus as lord of Horizon?]

Dee asks for Sapientiam {97}, Wisdom (Chokmah).

Dee gives the 7 names he has generated, and Michael corrects the spellings and orders, giving:

Galas
Gethog
Thaoth
Hor[omega]n = Horon
Innon
Aaoth
Galethog

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Galas</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Gethog</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Thaoth</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Horon</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Innon</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Aaoth</p></center>

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">Galethog</p></center>



Michael now adds the figures in the "almond slice" shaped figures above each of the seven heptagonal sides, followed by a cross over circle with joined "OG" inside it. After each letter shows he puts it in his bosom. Each circle segment is pure gold. 

M: Omnia unum est. {147} (All is one)

M pulls all 7 plates from bosom, Uriel kneels down.

Basket of east is opened. M: Divide the 7 parts of circle next unto that which thou hast done, every one, into 7. Dee: Seven, rest in 7: and the 7, live by 7: The 7, govern the 7: And by 7, all Government is. Blessed be he, yea blessed be the Lord: praised be our god. His Name be magnified. All honor and Glory be unto him now and for ever. Amen.

Michael pulls seven birds out of baskets, each with letters in its feathers.

[These form the names of the seven sides of the heptagon inside the outer rung.]

[Note: [Language of the Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds)]

[These may be Qabalistic code; they seem more suggestive of alchemical emblems, however.]

**1. ZllRHia** White pigeon. Z on 1st 7 feathers of breast, first feather on left side. M: Mystery in 7, which are the 7 governing the 7 which govern the earth.

**2. aZCaacb** White swan. M: Dixit et factum est. {181} (He spoke and it was so)

**3. paupnhr** Green peacock. M: Et viuis tu cum illo: et: regnum tuum cum illis est. {496} (And you live with him, and your kingdom is with those.) 7 gold, fiery feathers.

**4. hdmhiai** Red, fiery gryphon, scales like brass. Dedit illi potestatem in caelus. Potestas illius magna est. Orate. {576} (He gave power to them in heaven. His power is great. Pray.)

**5. kkaaééé** Gold Eagle, circle of feathers in breast, 12 equal squares between four parallel lines, and one on top.[JL: Reminiscent, perhaps, of the breastplate worn by the High Priest of the Israelites, though this may be a stretch.] Magnum est DEVS in Angelis suis. et magna est illorum potestas in Caelis. {642} (Mighty is GOD in his angels, and great is their power in heaven. Pray"

**6. iiéélll** Phoenix or Pelican, size of swan, fiery and sparkling. Bill bent into breast and it bled. [18º SR/Rosicrucianism] M: Nuncius tuus est magnus in caelis. Nuncius {91} = Medieval latin for Gabriel (Messenger of Heaven). Uriel now appears, also with legs like pillars of brass. "This is a mystery. He is here, and not here which was here before. {Dee: ie Michael}"  [Pelican is a common Medieval symbol and can even represent the Passion of Christ and the Eucharist. [here](http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast244.htm) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican#Christianity)

**NOTE: Sir Francis Drake's famous ship was initially called Pelican, and adorned the British halfpenny coin.[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican#Christianity)**

**7. ééllMG+** Fowl with many wings, with Tablet on forehead. [Note: Not birds, but Seraphim have six wings. [Isaiah 6:2](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm)] M: Dedit angelis potestatem in lumine Calei. (He gave power to his angels in the splendor of heaven.) (Geburah/Hod—pillar of severity; connecting path M, water, Hanged Man. Note Mem as first letter of Michael.) M again appears w legs of brass. 

M: Et Coniunxit illos DEV in unum. {307} (And God joined them into one.)

Baskets fly up, vanish, heaven appears. Michael tells Uriel to expound the Mysteries (this seems his job). Dee asks for perfect knowledge and Understanding (Da'ath and Binah). They leave the two to contemplate it for 15 minutes, then return. 

In Enochian, these seven Heptagonal names may be: 

<center>
<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">ZllRHia</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">aZCaacb</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">paupnhr</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">hdmhiai</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">kkaaeee</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">iieelll</p>

<p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">eellMG+</p>
</center>

7 diverse (multiple?) crosses and 7 letters: 7 seats of the One and everlasting God. 7 angels proceeding from every letter and Cross so formed.

This outer name (on gold plates) is: GALETHOG

Enochian:

<center><p style="font-family: Enochian Writing">GALETHOG</p></center>


Substance: FATHER

Form: SON

Inwardly: HOLY GHOST

[Note: All seven letters contain cross or cross/circle {Rose-Cross?} motifs, EXCEPT "XE," unless X is taken as a cross. These seem perhaps some kind of Cross/Circle permutations.  ]

Every letter contains an angel of brightness, comprehending the 7 inward powers of God (holy ghost) known to none but himself. Sufficient BOND [Dee calls emphasis to this] to urge all Creatures to life or Death, or anything else contained in the world. Banishes wicked, expels evil spirits, qualifies water, strengthens just, exalts righteous, destroys Wicke. 1 in 7, Twice in 3 (i.e. 2 x 3 + 1). Refer the numbers to upper circle. 

[Begin Duquette.

Combining the seven names of the outer ring with the seven sigils revealed within, we get:

Galas (+G5 sigil)

Gethog (A+25 sigil)

Thaoth (+oL sigil)

Horon (XE sigil)

Innon (oT sigil — note OTO / Operating Thetan)

Aaoth (HoT sigil)

Galethog (Tog sigil)

Taken together, we receive the "Supreme God Name of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth"

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9Zr99U2.png"></center>


[NOTE: The legs like Pillars of Brass most likely represent Boaz and Jachin, the pillars of Solomon and initiation into the Western mysteries, particularly Masonry. They stood on the porch of the First Temple, and were taken to Babylon by the Chaldeans; they of course also later appear in the High Priestess card for Gimel, initiating to Kether. All of these (even Masonry—how long do the pillars go back?) antedate the Enochian revelations [Wait, no. see below.]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaz_and_Jachin The message here seems to be of Michael and Uriel acting as Initiators into the Mysteries. The pillars were 18 cubits {27 feet) high and 12 cubits (18 feet) in circumference {5.7 ft diameter}.

[History of pillars](http://phoenixmasonry.org/history_of_the_two_pillars.htm)

"Also around 1450 the will of a mason from Beverley gives a tantalising glimpse into the emergence of masonic regalia. An inventory of John Cadeby's possessions mentions several zonas, or girdles. Two were silver mounted, and one of these had the letters B and I in the middle, indicating Boaz and Jachin,the twin pillars of Solomon's Temple.[34] He also owned a writing table and six English books, making him comfortably well-off and literate.[35]" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry) From  John Yarker, The Arcane Schools, Manchester 1909, pp341-342
]

[Also note Crowley's similar use of a bird code in "The Heart of the Master". The birds used there are:

Swan: AUMGN
Phoenix: AL
Raven: AMEN
Eagle: SU
Hawk: AGLA
Pelican: IAO
Dove: HRILIU
Ibis: ABRAHADABRA
Vulture: MU}
]



As darkness is lightened, so is spirit of god lightened. And so do they slowly lighten the darkness of Dee and Kelley.

[The structure of the initiation seems very similar to the expository nature of Masonic initiation, with Michael and Uriel intermittently taking oratory roles to initiate their students.]

*Every letter of which* contains or comprehends the number of 72 virtues. They will know these names, but they are scarce yet revealed to the world. 

Innumerable angels above them, wings of fire. (In Chamber or Study about them—not just in crystal!)

Action ends at 17:00:00 (During this time the Ascendant would have moved through Leo and into Virgo)

## Action Eleven. March 21, 1582, 2:00 PM

<center><img src=http://i.imgur.com/HjK8GiZ.gif></center>

Cancer is again ascendant, which Uriel had perhaps requested the prior day. The Moon has moved into Libra.

As usual, Michael is in seat and Uriel is leaning on table. A new angel comes in: A Trumpeter [Shin?] in white, garments have blood spots on them. Gold trumpet with plain sound. 

PHANAEL is mentioned by Michael. This is the Trumpeter. Phanuel is often associated with Uriel; is mentioned l in 1 Enoch List 2 and by the Gnostics. The two are sometimes conflated but 1 Enoch specifies they are different beings.

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanuel_(angel))

Peh Nun Aleph Lamed = 161

Peh Heh Nun Aleph Lamed = 166

Peh Heh Aleph Nun Aleph Lamed = 167

Peh Heh Aleph Nun Aleph Aleph Lamed = 168

"This first is Michael, the merciful and long-suffering: and the second, who is set over all the diseases and all the wounds of the children of men, is Raphael: and the third, who is set over all the powers, is Gabriel: and the fourth, who is set over the repentance unto hope of those who inherit eternal life, is named Phanuel. (1 Enoch 40:9)"

MIchael says: *Don't ask about my clothes.* Dee asks for Wisdom. Michael says Wisdom is nothing and will perish in eternity (Chokmah -> Kether/Ain). May lord's eternity come from every part of world if Lord Adonai wishes.

Phanael blows trumpet across 7 parts of world, divided equally along horizon. From each part come 7 companies of **pillars of fire** color glittering; the heaven, sun, moon, stars all tremble. 

M: MULTIPLEX EST DEUS NOSTER {282 - Angels of Briah, and of Malkuth of Briah; Spirit of Lives} {Book quote} - "Manifold is our god". 7 comprehendeth secrets of heaven and earth. Seven knitteth man's soul and body together (3 in soul, 4 in body). [This sounds familiar from V&V but I can't find the passage.]

In 7 you find unity, trinity, son, proportion of Holy Ghost (7 Thrones, 7 Trumpets, 7 Angels, all praising god). In 7 god wrought all things; in 7 and by 7 you must work all things. 7 x 7

Both angels kneel, pillars of firey brass now about them. Sic est DEVS noster {195}: such is our god

[Note: Pillars appear in Aethyr 30 and 21 (also 19, 16, 15, 14, 12)

[Aren't 49 pillars used in the VIº OTO initiation? No—8 pillars]

pommel or mace head atop one. Michael takes a thing like an S out of it. Pillars lean down 7 at a time giving names.

SAAIEME 8

Pillars join at top making one mace or pommel, and fly to heaven. 

Of interest?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism

[In Christianity, the man, lion, ox, and eagle are used as symbols for the four evangelists (or gospel-writers),[25] and appear frequently in church decorations. These Creatures are called Zoë (or the Tetramorph), and surround the throne of God in Heaven, along with twenty-four elders and seven spirits of God (according to Revelation 4:1–11).]

[Kabbalah relates the Merkabah vision of Ezekiel and the Throne vision of Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1–8) describing the seraph angels, to its comprehensive Four spiritual realms. The highest World, Atziluth ("Emanation"-Divine wisdom), is the realm of absolute Divine manifestation without self-awareness, metaphorically described in the vision as the likeness of a Man on the throne. The throne of sapphire is an etymological root in Kabbalah for the Sephirot divine powers. The second World, Beriah ("Creation"-Divine understanding), is the first independent root creation, the realm of the Throne,[20] denoting God descending into Creation, as a king limits his true greatness and revealed posture when seated. The World of Beriah is the realm of the higher angels, the Seraphim ("burning" in ascent and descent as their understanding of God motivates self-annihilation).[20] The third World, Yetzirah ("Formation"-Divine emotions), is the realm of archetypal existence, the abode of the main Hayyot angels ("alive" with divine emotion). They are described with faces of a lion, ox and eagle, as their emotional nature is instinctive like animals, and they are the archetypal origins of creatures in this World. The lowest World, Assiah ("Action"-Divine rulership), is the realm guided by the lower channels of the Ophanim (humble "ways" in realised creation).

The Rabbinic Talmud compares Ezekiel and Isaiah's visions of God's Chariot-Throne, noticing that Ezekiel gives a lengthy account of details, while Isaiah is very brief. It gives an exoteric explanation for this; Isaiah prophesised in the era of Solomon's Temple, Ezekiel's vision took place in the exile of Babylonian captivity. Rava states in the Babylonian Talmud that although Ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of God, this is not because he had seen more than Isaiah, but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar.[21] Ezekiel, like all prophets except Moses, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.[22]

The Kabbalistic account explains this difference in terms of the Four Worlds. All prophecy emanates from the divine chokhmah (wisdom) realm of Atziluth.[20] However, in order to be perceived it descends to be enclothed in vessels of lower Worlds. Isaiah's prophecy saw the Merkabah in the World of Beriah divine understanding, restraining his explanation by realising the inadequacy of description. Ezekiel saw the Merkabah in the lower World of Yetzirah divine emotions, causing him to describe the vision in rapturous detail.

The two visions also form the Kedushah Jewish daily liturgy:

    We will sanctify Thy name in the world even as they sanctify it in the highest heavens, as it is written by the hand of Thy prophet: "And they (the Seraphim) called one unto the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory." (Isaiah 6:3)
    Those over against them (the Hayyot) say, Blessed: "Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place." (Ezekiel 3:12)
    And in Thy holy words it is written, saying: "The Lord shall reign forever, thy God, O Zion, unto all generations; Hallelujah." (Psalms 146:10)

According to the Kabbalistic explanation, the Seraphim ("burning" angels) in Beriah (divine understanding) realise their distance from the absolute divinity of Atziluth. Their call, "Holy", repeated three times, means removed or separated. This causes their "burning up" continual self-nullification, ascending to God and returning to their place. Their understanding realises instead that God's true purpose (glory) for creation is with lowly man. The lower Hayyot ("living" angels) in Yetzirah (divine emotions) say, "Blessed" (etymologically in Kabbalah "drawing down" blessing) be the glory...from "His (distant-unknown to them) place" of Atziluth. Though lower than the Seraphim, their emotional self-awareness has a superior advantage of powerful desire. This causes them to be able to draw down divine vitality from a higher source, the supreme realm of Atziluth, to lower creation and man. In Ezekiel's vision, the Hayyot have a central role in the merkabah's channeling of the divine flow in creation.]

2 pillars come down to take their place. Michael cuts them down, calling them wicked and of the work of Satan and iniquity. 

The previous pillars come back down, saying NON SVM {84} (I am not). [Is this Ain/Kether {and then 7} asserting themselves over duality/false dyad/Thaumiel? What of 0=2?

{84 = 7 x 12; (2^2+3)x(2^2x3); wing/squadron/troop; Was silent (!); Enoch (!); Knew {past tense.})

7 pillars to right hand bow and say SVM {47—same as Latin "Michael"; foolis, silly/weeping/cloud [pillar of cloud]} (I am). 

BTZ appears in great letters in hollow place like square cumfet (candy) boxes. Ista sunt secrete secretorum
secrete secretorum {192}

Call upon his name we alone can do nothing

Key with H at end

KASE, 30 with point under.

Pillars join and fly up with thunder. 

Praise the name of the Lord who lives forever.

Michael showed out of four their heads, of the pillars, and with all said, not the angels of heaven but i am privy of these things:

HEID

ENE (The Lord is stationed as his number)

(Thunder on disappear)

Fourth: Viuo sicut LEO in medio illorum (I live as a lion in your midst). LEO. M: And great is your power everywhere. Five (Geburah) tops plucked off, join together

EIMO

Hoc non est sine praece (This is not without prayer)

2 open: 30(dot) A. Close, go away w thunder. 

7 more appear: Voice: Serpens sum et deuoraui sepentem. (I AM A SERPENT, AND I DEVOURED TO SERPENT.) (Ouroboros)

[Ouroboros originates in Egyptian funerary texts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros . Surrounds Shiva. Plato, Norse, alchemy. kundalini. benzene. 

"You are a Serpent to both the good and evil, Lord" (!) (Unification of opposites in Da'ath? Duality below the Abyss?)

Out of last pillar, fire and innumerable angels like little children with wings.

Suddenly shut up.
Sic sic sic Deus noster {213}: Yes yes yes our god.

I H R L A A

Then seventh: trees leap up; hills/seas/waters troubled and thrown up. Consummatum est {175}. 
21/8.

[Is 21/8 a reference to Revelation 21:8? "But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”]

They join together and fly up heavenward: VNVS VNVS VNVS. Omnis caro timet vocem eius. [VNVS=67, Understanding. x 3 = 201 {Light, AR-Chaldean} [and = 3, 1+1+1.]

Ultimately, these form the following names, which are now placed *within* each side of the planetary Heptagon:

<center><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dOYB5l4.png></center>

Kelley is starting to trip out, so the angels say to take 15 minutes.

Be present o daughters of goodness...

These are the "Daughters of Light" ({121})

7 women in Green (Venus?) come in, heads attired with green silk, wreath behind hanging to ground. Michael strikes sword over them with no fire.
One: Blue tablet on forehead, EL thereon. They reveal their names as such [Duquette adds planetary attributions]:

E(l)—[she announces herself as El, but only E is in tablet]:				Saturn

Me:			Mars

7 young men come in. Bright countenance. White apparalled, white silk on heads, pendant behind (like daughters of light). 

[Duquette: These follow on the 7fold table from the daughters; so it is gendered male/female. Stimcul is repeated as center line]

Each carries a ball in hand:

[DUQUETTE APPEARS TO GET THE PLANETARY ATTRIBUTIONS WRONG—COMPLETELY REVERSED]

Though begotten (or not begotten) at one time, they are one. Quanmvis in uno generantur tempore, tamen unum sunt {535}

(These names are placed below the Daughters of Light. Is there some kind of Tetragrammatic attribution from outside in?)

They are also told to make items according to these examples when time comes! (More furniture?)

M: God said be mindful of my name, but you have forgotten.

Filiae Filiarum Lucis Venite {247}

**Daughters of Daughters**

7 "little wenches ([i.e. young unmarried girls](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wench))" White silk robes, white about head, pendant down behind very long. They were on Earth w saints, and in heaven with glorified. Thye have a speech impediment. They each had something in their hands, but the mystery is not yet to be known (planetary attributions uncertain?) 4-square tablets on bosoms, of white ivory.

Names are drawn from top left in, aiming to left.

Planetary attributions follow on as before (mine or Duquette's). 

(Names go next layer in)

**Sons of the Sons**

Filios Filiorum {157... not 156}

(Note the similarity, PERHAPS, to the latin tetragrammation used in the Star Sapphire.)

7 children, boys covered all in purple, hanging sleeves like priests or scholars' gowns, heads attired like scholars with purple silk (suggests Mercury / Bet). Three-cornered tablets on their breasts, very green, letters in them. (Purple/green - flashing colors? Green netzach?)

Names are drawn from bottom right in, aiming to right/top. 

Woe to those who cause temptation to sin.

Ese: Nec nomine meo timet Mundus. {254} The world does not fear my name.

An: Nullus videbut faciem mean. {227} Nobody will see my face. [JL: Nobody = NEMO]

Aue: Non est virgo super terram cui dicam. {338} There is no maiden on the earth with whom I will speak. [Virgo. He also points to tablet, where Aue is written.]

Liba: Tanta est infirmitas sanctitudinis Diei. Benefacientes decesserunt ab illo. {639} So great is the weakness of holiness of the day. The benefactors depart from him.

Rocle: Opera manuum illorum sunt vana. Nemo autem videbut me. {496} Their handiwork is in vain. Whereupon no one will see me. [Note direct mention of NEMO]

Hagonel: Ecce {16} - Hagonel - Qui adhuc Sancti sunt, cum illis viuo. {352} {368} Behold Hagonel, I live with those who are still holy.

Ilemese: Hij imitaurunt doctrinam meam, In me Omnis sita est Doctrina. {533} They have imitated my teaching. The teaching of all things are place in me. (Mercury/Chokmah/Logos?)

These are placed in the inner heptagon. 

Michael again passes off to Uriel to interpret in the usual partnership.

Uriel gives the table (Fig 37 above). These are the names of God not known to angels, and which cannot be spoken by men. "Blessed is he who keeps his own names secret." Names bring forth 7 angels and governors **in the heavens next to us** [emphasis Dee's] which stand always before the face of God.

Every letter brings forth 7 daughters. Every daughter also brings forth a daughter (7), every daughter-daughter brings forth a son (7), every son brings forth a son (7). 28 total

Duquette's (very likely wrong) planetary attributions.

Duquette notes that crosses were placed around the Sigillum in an inconsistent manner. AGLA cross (Ateh Gibor le-Olam Amen) on the back.
