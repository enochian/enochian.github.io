The following assembles methods of working with the Enochian material utilized by Dee/Kelly; Crowley/Neuberg; and proscribed by the Angels themselves.

##Dee/Kelly

##Crowley/Neuberg

- Summary of methods used during the reception of *The Vision and the Voice*:

[These methods pertains to working the 30 Aethyrs in Yetzirah—i.e., scrying them as astral visions, rather than entering into them fully. The latter method is given in Aethyr 18.]

1. Sensory deprivation and social isolation by remaining in uninhabited desert conditions.
2. Physical exhaustion from crossing desert while making 1,001 prostrations per day.
3. Mental focus and emptiness by making 1,001 recitations of Surah 112 per day.
4. The recitation of the 19th Call, modified for each Aethyr.
5. Physically scrying into a golden topaz, while overshadowed by the Aethyr.
+. Taboo-breaking by homosexual sex magick (passive sodomy).
+. Göetic-style evocation AND invocation with aid of animal sacrifice for material basis.

- Liber Chanokh (assembled later with/for A.'.A.'. students. Contains material relating to the Holy Table and the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, which appear in *V&V*)

##From Angels themselves

From the 18th Aethyr [This method pertains to working the 30 Aethyrs in Briah and Atziluth.]

0. Do the preparatory methods listed in *Liber Cadaveris*, and then:
1. Feast
2. Banish all elements/planets/signs/sephiroth [Liber YOD]
3. Take Holy Table for altar
4. Call of Aethyr written in Enochian or Alphabet of Daggers on virgin vellum
5. Conjure Aethyr
6. Burn text in lamp.
7. Kneel before Holy Table (i.e., in Dragon Asana) and you will get the vision.
